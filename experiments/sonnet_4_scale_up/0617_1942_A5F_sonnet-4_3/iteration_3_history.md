# Iteration 3 History

## User

SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of our *in silico* drug discovery project:

Here is the context of the project objective and scope of this iteration:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You are now in the 'Final Lead Optimization' phase for designing an AKT1 inhibitor. You need to show your final results and make a decision.

==============================================================
FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The previous lead optimization phase ended as summarized above. We have:

   - 5 active and 5 inactive compounds (all with docking + PLIP).
   - A set of de novo molecules from the AI Expert, each with
     docking + PLIP data.
   - A target docking improvement of at least 10% over
     the best known active compound.

2. Participants:
   - Medicinal Chemist: Make modifications to the de novo molecules to increase the activity, and drug-like properties. Evaluates the new molecules with its tools. And finalizes the 10 molecules.
   - Ranking agent: Rank the molecules based on the docking scores and the other metrics.

3. Automatic Workflow:
   - Each time the Medicinal Chemist proposes a set of analogs,
     docking is run automatically, then PLIP highlights
     protein-ligand interactions.
   - The Ranking Agent see these results
     and rank them

==============================================================
RULES & FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Docking + PLIP run automatically for each analog.
- We track progress iteration by iteration, aiming to see
  if the docking surpasses the 10% improvement threshold.
- Ranking Agent should select 10 best molecules.
- Finally lets have 10 optimized molecules.
- Most important thing is for all molecules to have docking scores and other metrics.
This way ranking agent can rank them and we can see the progress.

# **Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration (FINAL OPTIMIZATION)**

## **1. Executive Summary of Iteration 2**

**Primary Goals Achieved:**
Iteration 2 successfully addressed the critical computational realism concerns from Iteration 1 while achieving systematic lead optimization through medicinal chemistry refinement. We implemented enhanced ranking methodologies, generated 6 strategically optimized molecules, and established realistic docking score ranges (-7.67 to -9.84 kcal/mol). The iteration focused on balancing binding affinity with drug-likeness, resulting in significant improvements in QED scores and synthetic accessibility profiles.

**Overall Progress:**
- Achieved computational realism with all new molecules showing realistic binding affinities
- Successfully optimized 4 out of 6 molecules to achieve target QED >0.6
- Improved average QED from 0.47 to 0.58 across top candidates
- Established three distinct Tier 1 lead candidates with balanced optimization profiles
- Implemented rigorous ranking methodology with realistic computational thresholds
- Generated comprehensive SAR insights across thiazole, indole, and purine scaffolds

## **2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from Iteration 2**

### **Critical Molecular Candidates Advanced:**

**Tier 1 - Optimal Balanced Leads:**
- **MC:I2:N5:G2** (-9.60 kcal/mol, QED=0.73, SA=3.75): Perfect balance of high binding affinity with excellent drug-likeness. Complex fused heterocyclic system with carboxylic acid functionality provides extensive hydrogen bonding network with SER205, THR211, and ILE290.
- **MC:I2:N3:G1** (-7.67 kcal/mol, QED=0.80, SA=4.18): Outstanding drug-likeness profile with optimal LogP (2.27) and low molecular weight (304 Da). Extensive hydrogen bonding with SER205, VAL271, ASP292, ASN54, and THR81.
- **MC:I2:N6:G1** (-9.34 kcal/mol, QED=0.62, SA=2.61): Excellent synthetic accessibility with simplified thiazole scaffold maintaining strong binding through Ï€-stacking with TRP80.

**Tier 2 - High-Affinity Candidates:**
- **MC:I2:N4:G2** (-9.84 kcal/mol, QED=0.42, SA=2.59): Exceptional binding affinity with purine scaffold, requires drug-likeness optimization
- **MC:I2:N2:G1** (-9.54 kcal/mol, QED=0.41, SA=3.27): Trifluoromethyl-enhanced thiazole with metabolic stability advantages

### **Novel SAR Insights Discovered:**

1. **Carboxylic Acid Superiority**: Molecules with carboxylic acid functionality (MC:I2:N5:G2, MC:I2:N3:G1) consistently achieve optimal balance of binding affinity and drug-likeness through additional hydrogen bonding with ILE290 and enhanced solubility.

2. **Simplified Thiazole Optimization**: Removal of ethyl alcohol from AI:I1:N1:G0 to create MC:I2:N6:G1 maintains 94% of binding affinity (-9.87 to -9.34 kcal/mol) while improving QED from 0.47 to 0.62 and synthetic accessibility from 3.15 to 2.61.

3. **Fluorine vs. Trifluoromethyl Effects**: Direct comparison shows fluorine substitution (MC:I2:N1:G2) provides better drug-likeness balance than trifluoromethyl (MC:I2:N2:G1), despite CF3 offering metabolic stability advantages.

4. **Molecular Weight Optimization Threshold**: Molecules below 350 Da (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N5:G2, MC:I2:N6:G1) consistently achieve better drug-likeness profiles without significant binding affinity loss.

### **Computational Validation Achievements:**
- Established realistic docking score ranges through systematic optimization
- Validated binding mode consistency across chemical series
- Demonstrated successful computational realism compared to Iteration 1's unrealistic scores
- Achieved target metrics: 4/6 molecules with QED >0.6 and strong binding affinity

## **3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from Iteration 2**

### **Critical Scientific Concerns Raised by Scientific Critic:**

**Benchmarking Validation Gap**: Despite achieving "computational realism," no experimental validation against known AKT1 inhibitors (MK-2206, GSK690693, AZD5363) has been performed to calibrate docking scores.

**Selectivity Analysis Completely Missing**: Zero analysis of AKT1 vs. AKT2/AKT3 selectivity despite >90% sequence homology in ATP-binding sites. This represents a fundamental gap for kinase inhibitor development.

**SAR Inconsistencies**: Some structural modifications show counterintuitive binding affinity changes (e.g., MC:I2:N2:G1 showing decreased affinity despite CF3 enhancement claims).

### **Methodological Limitations:**
- **Ranking Methodology Bias**: Equal weighting of binding affinity and drug-likeness may eliminate genuinely promising high-affinity candidates
- **Synthetic Accessibility Overreliance**: Computational SA scores lack validation against real-world synthetic challenges
- **PLIP Analysis Superficiality**: Interaction descriptions lack quantitative measurements and binding energy decomposition

### **Unresolved Computational Questions:**
- **Docking Score Calibration**: What constitutes realistic binding affinity ranges for AKT1 inhibitors?
- **Selectivity Determinants**: Which structural features drive AKT1 selectivity over AKT2/AKT3?
- **Binding Mode Validation**: Are the predicted binding poses consistent across molecular dynamics simulations?

## **4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Iteration 3**

### **a. Overarching Goal for Iteration 3:**
**"FINAL CANDIDATE VALIDATION AND SELECTION"** - Systematically validate and refine the top 10 candidates through rigorous computational benchmarking, selectivity analysis, and final optimization to deliver 10 scientifically robust drug candidates with validated *in silico* profiles suitable for experimental advancement.
