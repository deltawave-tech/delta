# Iteration 3 History

## User

SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of our *in silico* drug discovery project:

Here is the context of the project objective and scope of this iteration:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You are now in the 'Final Lead Optimization' phase for designing an AKT1 inhibitor. You need to show your final results and make a decision.

==============================================================
FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The previous lead optimization phase ended as summarized above. We have:

   - 5 active and 5 inactive compounds (all with docking + PLIP).
   - A set of de novo molecules from the AI Expert, each with
     docking + PLIP data.
   - A target docking improvement of at least 10% over
     the best known active compound.

2. Participants:
   - Medicinal Chemist: Make modifications to the de novo molecules to increase the activity, and drug-like properties. Evaluates the new molecules with its tools. And finalizes the 10 molecules.
   - Ranking agent: Rank the molecules based on the docking scores and the other metrics.

3. Automatic Workflow:
   - Each time the Medicinal Chemist proposes a set of analogs,
     docking is run automatically, then PLIP highlights
     protein-ligand interactions.
   - The Ranking Agent see these results
     and rank them

==============================================================
RULES & FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Docking + PLIP run automatically for each analog.
- We track progress iteration by iteration, aiming to see
  if the docking surpasses the 10% improvement threshold.
- Ranking Agent should select 10 best molecules.
- Finally lets have 10 optimized molecules.
- Most important thing is for all molecules to have docking scores and other metrics.
This way ranking agent can rank them and we can see the progress.

## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from Iteration 2

### **Critical Computational Validation Gaps Identified:**

**Docking Reliability Concerns:**
- Single-program docking without consensus scoring raises reliability questions
- Protonation state analysis missing for basic molecules (e.g., MC:I2:N8:G3 piperazine pKa ~9.8)
- Binding pose validation through molecular dynamics simulations not performed
- PLIP interaction anomalies (MC:I2:N7:G3 showing non-active site residue interactions)

**ADMET Prediction Limitations:**
- Overreliance on LogP and QED metrics without comprehensive ADMET profiling
- Missing critical assessments: hERG liability, metabolic stability, permeability predictions
- No evaluation of metabolic soft spots (e.g., MC:I2:N4:G2 primary alcohol oxidation liability)
- Absence of plasma protein binding and clearance predictions

**Selectivity Assessment Void:**
- No AKT2/AKT3 selectivity analysis despite >85% sequence homology in ATP-binding site
- Pan-kinase selectivity screening completely absent
- Off-target liability assessment not performed
- Blood-brain barrier penetration implications not considered

### **Unresolved Scientific Questions:**

1. **Binding Mode Validation**: Are the predicted binding poses for top candidates stable under dynamic conditions?
2. **Selectivity-Potency Relationship**: How do structural modifications affect AKT1 vs AKT2/AKT3 selectivity?
3. **ADMET Liability Resolution**: Can computational ADMET predictions be validated through experimental correlation?
4. **Synthetic Feasibility Reality**: Are SA scores realistic for complex polycyclic structures like MC:I2:N8:G3?
5. **Experimental Correlation**: How do computational predictions correlate with biochemical and cellular activity data?

### **Methodological Limitations:**
- Lack of uncertainty quantification for all computational predictions
- Absence of cross-validation for computational models
- No statistical confidence intervals for docking scores and property predictions
