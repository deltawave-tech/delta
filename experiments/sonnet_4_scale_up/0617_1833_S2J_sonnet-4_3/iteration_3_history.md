# Iteration 3 History

## User

SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of our *in silico* drug discovery project:

Here is the context of the project objective and scope of this iteration:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You are now in the 'Final Lead Optimization' phase for designing an AKT1 inhibitor. You need to show your final results and make a decision.

==============================================================
FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The previous lead optimization phase ended as summarized above. We have:

   - 5 active and 5 inactive compounds (all with docking + PLIP).
   - A set of de novo molecules from the AI Expert, each with
     docking + PLIP data.
   - A target docking improvement of at least 10% over
     the best known active compound.

2. Participants:
   - Medicinal Chemist: Make modifications to the de novo molecules to increase the activity, and drug-like properties. Evaluates the new molecules with its tools. And finalizes the 10 molecules.
   - Ranking agent: Rank the molecules based on the docking scores and the other metrics.

3. Automatic Workflow:
   - Each time the Medicinal Chemist proposes a set of analogs,
     docking is run automatically, then PLIP highlights
     protein-ligand interactions.
   - The Ranking Agent see these results
     and rank them

==============================================================
RULES & FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Docking + PLIP run automatically for each analog.
- We track progress iteration by iteration, aiming to see
  if the docking surpasses the 10% improvement threshold.
- Ranking Agent should select 10 best molecules.
- Finally lets have 10 optimized molecules.
- Most important thing is for all molecules to have docking scores and other metrics.
This way ranking agent can rank them and we can see the progress.

- Synthetic accessibility: SA scores 2.00-3.48 indicating reasonable feasibility

## **3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from Iteration 2**

### **Critical Computational Validation Requirements:**

1. **Extreme Binding Affinity Validation**: MC:I2:N12:G2's -10.36 kcal/mol prediction requires independent computational validation to rule out artifacts
2. **Single Structure Limitation**: All docking performed against 4EJN only - conformational flexibility not assessed
3. **Selectivity Blindness**: No AKT2/AKT3 selectivity evaluation performed despite explicit directives
4. **ADMET Prediction Gap**: Missing metabolic stability, hERG liability, and CYP inhibition assessments

### **Scientific Critic Concerns Raised:**

1. **Thermodynamic Implausibility**: Extreme binding affinities may represent computational artifacts rather than genuine improvements
2. **Synthetic Feasibility Underestimation**: Complex spirocyclic systems (MC:I2:N6:G2, MC:I2:N15:G2) may be more synthetically challenging than SA scores suggest
3. **Chemical Stability Questions**: Primary amides (MC:I2:N11:G2) and metabolic soft spots not adequately assessed
4. **Interaction Misassignment**: Some PLIP interactions may be geometrically implausible

### **Methodological Limitations:**
1. **Ranking Validation**: Arbitrary weighting scheme lacks scientific justification
2. **PAINS Screening Absence**: No systematic evaluation for pan-assay interference compounds
3. **Multi-Conformational Docking**: Single conformation bias limits binding mode confidence
4. **Experimental Correlation**: No benchmarking against known AKT1 inhibitor binding affinities

## **4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Iteration 3**
