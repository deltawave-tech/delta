# Iteration 2 History

## User

SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 2 of 3** of our *in silico* drug discovery project:

Here is the context of the project objective and scope of this iteration:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You are now in the 'Lead Optimization' phase for designing AKT1 inhibitors.

==============================================================
LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The brainstorming phase ended with a clear plan (referred
   to here as 'the strategy'), which guides how the Medicinal
   Chemist should modify or optimize molecules. We have:

   - 5 active and 5 inactive compounds (all with docking + PLIP).
   - de novo molecules from the AI Expert, each with
     docking + PLIP data.

2. Participants:
   - Medicinal Chemist: proposes new analogs per iteration and finalize the 10 molecules.
   - Ranking Agent: Rank the molecules based on the docking scores and the other metrics.
   - Scientific Critic: checks for logical or scientific
     inconsistencies, advises caution if modifications seem
     unfeasible or contradictory.

3. Automatic Workflow:
   - Each time the Medicinal Chemist proposes a set of analogs,
     docking should run by the its tools, then PLIP highlights
     protein-ligand interactions.
   - The Ranking Agent and Critic see these results
     and give feedback.

==============================================================
RULES & FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Each iteration begins with the Medicinal Chemist proposing
  3 structural modifications based on the prior feedback,
  docking, and PLIP results.
- Docking + PLIP run automatically for each analog.
- The Scientific Critic can highlight any chemical or
  logical red flags.
- We track progress iteration by iteration, aiming to see
  if the docking surpasses the 10% improvement threshold.
- Finally lets have 10 optimized molecules.
- Most important thing is for all molecules to have docking scores and other metrics.
This way ranking agent can rank them and we can see the progress.
==============================================================
END OF SYSTEM PROMPT

# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration LEAD OPTIMIZATION

## 1. Executive Summary of Iteration 1

In this initial iteration, our team successfully established a foundation for the development of novel AKT1 inhibitors through a comprehensive in silico approach. We identified the AKT1 protein structure (PDB: 4EJN), characterized its binding site, retrieved reference active/inactive compounds, generated diverse novel molecules, and performed preliminary optimization. Through this process, we identified several promising scaffolds with excellent predicted binding to AKT1, including sulfonamide, pyrazole, and indazole-based structures. The most promising candidates demonstrated strong docking scores (-10.94 to -9.69 kcal/mol), favorable drug-like properties, and key interactions with critical binding site residues (Thr-211, Asp-292, Trp-80). This iteration has provided a solid platform for more focused optimization in Iteration 2.

</ranking>

## 2. Key In Silico Findings & Discoveries from Iteration 1

### Protein Target Characterization
- AKT1 structure (PDB: 4EJN, 2.19Å resolution) was identified as suitable for docking studies
- Key binding site residues include Thr-211, Asp-292, Val-270, Tyr-272, and Trp-80
- Critical interactions for potent binding include H-bonds with Thr-211, salt bridges with Asp-292, and π-stacking with Trp-80

### Reference Compounds and SAR Insights
- Active AKT1 inhibitors from databases featured piperidine cores with various linkers (ester, amide, alkene) or quinoxaline scaffolds
- The nature of the linker significantly impacts activity, with ester and amide linkers preferred over secondary amines
- High lipophilicity (logP > 7) appears detrimental to activity despite good docking scores

### Novel Scaffolds and Lead Compounds
- **Top-ranked compound MC:I1:N3:G1** (sulfonamide derivative, docking: -10.94 kcal/mol): Features a methylpiperidine connected to a tetrahydroisoquinoline core with a fluorophenyl sulfonamide group. Forms critical interactions with Thr-211, Asn-54, Gln-79, and a salt bridge with Asp-292.

- **Second-ranked compound MC:I1:N2:G1** (pyrazole derivative, docking: -10.01 kcal/mol): Contains a fluorophenyl-pyrazole scaffold with a pyrimidine substituent. Demonstrates excellent synthetic accessibility (SA: 2.55) and forms a key H-bond with Thr-211.

- **Third-ranked compound MC:I1:N1:G1** (indazole derivative, docking: -9.69 kcal/mol): Features a fluoroindazole connected to a methylpiperidine via a benzamide linker. Shows excellent drug-likeness (QED: 0.75) and balanced physicochemical properties (logP: 2.92).

- **Hybrid compound MC:I1:N5:G1** (docking: -9.23 kcal/mol): Combines the benzimidazolone scaffold from DA:I1:N5:G0 with the piperidine-amide linker from DA:I1:N4:G0, demonstrating the value of hybrid design approaches.

### Key Pharmacophoric Features Identified
1. H-bond acceptors positioned to interact with Thr-211 and Asn-53/54
2. Basic nitrogen centers forming salt bridges with Asp-292
3. Aromatic groups positioned for π-stacking with Trp-80
4. Hydrophobic groups interacting with Val-270 and Tyr-272
5. Optimal balance of lipophilicity (logP 3-5) for favorable binding and drug-like properties

## 3. In Silico Challenges & Unresolved Questions from Iteration 1

### Methodological Limitations
- **Docking score reliability**: Heavy reliance on docking scores without consensus scoring or ensemble docking approaches
- **Single protein conformation**: Use of a single protein structure fails to account for protein flexibility
- **Binding site water molecules**: Role of conserved water molecules in binding was not addressed
- **Limited pharmacophore development**: Formal pharmacophore model was not developed to guide design

### Scientific Gaps
- **Selectivity assessment**: Limited consideration of selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2/AKT3 isoforms
- **ADME property prediction**: Insufficient evaluation of metabolic stability, potential toxicity issues, and pharmacokinetic properties
- **Structural diversity**: Limited exploration of diverse chemotypes beyond nitrogen-containing heterocycles
- **Synthetic feasibility**: Potential disconnect between computational SA scores and actual synthetic complexity

### Unresolved Questions
1. What structural features confer selectivity for AKT1 over AKT2/AKT3?
2. How can we balance potency (docking score) with drug-like properties for optimal in vivo performance?
3. What are the metabolic liabilities of our top compounds, and how can they be addressed?
4. Which scaffolds offer the best combination of potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties?
5. How reliable are our docking predictions for the novel scaffolds without experimental validation?

## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable In Silico Directives for Next Iteration

### a. Overarching Goal for Iteration 2
To optimize the top-ranked molecules from Iteration 1 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications that enhance predicted binding affinity, improve drug-like properties, address potential metabolic liabilities, and begin exploring selectivity for AKT1 over related kinases. The primary objective is to develop 15-20 optimized compounds with balanced profiles of potency, selectivity, and drug-likeness for final refinement in Iteration 3.

### b. Specific Tasks & Focus Areas for Each Available Agent in Iteration 2

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "# Commencement of Iteration 2: Lead Optimization for AKT1 Inhibitors\n\n## Primary Objective and Context\n\nWe are conducting an in silico drug discovery project targeting AKT1 (Protein Kinase B alpha), a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that plays a critical role in multiple cellular processes including metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis. AKT1 is a validated therapeutic target for various diseases, particularly cancer, where its dysregulation contributes to tumor development and progression.\n\nOur approach is entirely computational, using the AKT1 protein structure (PDB: 4EJN, 2.19Å resolution) to design potent and selective inhibitors through iterative optimization. We have completed the initial brainstorming phase (Iteration 1) and are now in the Lead Optimization phase (Iteration 2), where we will refine our most promising candidates to enhance their binding affinity, drug-like properties, and address potential metabolic liabilities.\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on our findings from Iteration 1, our team must focus on the following critical objectives:\n\n1. **Optimize our top three compounds** (MC:I1:N3:G1, MC:I1:N2:G1, MC:I1:N1:G1) through systematic medicinal chemistry modifications to:\n   - Enhance binding affinity (docking scores)\n   - Improve drug-like properties (QED, logP, MW)\n   - Address potential metabolic liabilities\n   - Maintain or strengthen key interactions with critical residues (Thr-211, Asp-292, Trp-80)\n\n2. **Create hybrid molecules** combining favorable features from different scaffolds to explore synergistic improvements in binding and properties.\n\n3. **Explore alternative scaffolds** not extensively investigated in Iteration 1 to ensure structural diversity in our final candidates.\n\n4. **Implement a comprehensive ranking system** that balances potency, key interactions, drug-likeness, synthetic accessibility, predicted metabolic stability, and structural novelty.\n\n5. **Critically evaluate** all modifications for scientific rationale, consistency with established medicinal chemistry principles, and potential introduction of new liabilities.\n\n## Points of Emphasis for Specific Agents\n\n### For Medicinal Chemist:\n- Focus on addressing the high lipophilicity (logP: 5.71) of MC:I1:N3:G1 while maintaining its excellent docking score\n- Enhance the H-bonding network of MC:I1:N2:G1 and address potential metabolic instability\n- Protect the indazole NH of MC:I1:N1:G1 from metabolism and mitigate potential hERG liability\n- Ensure all proposed modifications are accompanied by clear scientific rationale\n\n### For Ranking Agent:\n- Implement the comprehensive ranking system outlined in the directives\n- Provide detailed rationale for rankings, highlighting strengths and weaknesses\n- Identify the top 15-20 compounds to carry forward to Iteration 3\n\n### For Scientific Critic:\n- Critically evaluate all modifications for scientific soundness and potential liabilities\n- Assess the robustness of the ranking methodology\n- Identify remaining scientific gaps to address in Iteration 3\n\n## Delegation to First Agent\n\nI now invite the **Medicinal Chemist** to begin this iteration by proposing three structural modifications to our top compounds from Iteration 1. Please focus on:\n\n1. Reducing the lipophilicity of MC:I1:N3:G1 (sulfonamide derivative) while maintaining its excellent binding profile\n2. Enhancing the H-bonding network of MC:I1:N2:G1 (pyrazole derivative) and addressing its potential metabolic instability\n3. Protecting the indazole NH of MC:I1:N1:G1 from metabolism and mitigating potential hERG liability\n\nFor each modification, please provide a clear scientific rationale and ensure that the VINA_REPORT tool is used to evaluate the impact on binding mode and interactions. Let's proceed with these focused optimizations to advance our AKT1 inhibitor development."}]

The N-methylated indazole addresses metabolic stability concerns, and the balanced physicochemical properties (logP 4.30) make it our top candidate. The combination of structural features from two successful scaffolds represents an excellent optimization strategy.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1 (Rank #2)**: With an excellent docking score (-11.0 kcal/mol) and a critical salt bridge with Asp-292, this molecule ranks second. The protected indazole NH improves metabolic stability, and the incorporation of a sulfonamide group enhances binding. The slightly higher molecular weight (552.65) is the main drawback.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N4:G1 (Rank #3)**: This optimized version of MC:I1:N3:G1 maintains an excellent docking score (-10.91 kcal/mol) while significantly improving the lipophilicity profile (logP reduced from 5.71 to 4.32). The addition of a primary amide and a second fluorine creates additional interactions, including a halogen bond with Val-271.\n\n4. **MC:I1:N3:G1 (Rank #4)**: Despite being from Iteration 1, this molecule still ranks highly due to its excellent docking score (-10.94 kcal/mol) and key interactions with Thr-211 and Asp-292. However, its high lipophilicity (logP 5.71) remains a concern.\n\n5. **MC:I2:N3:G1 (Rank #5)**: This molecule offers an excellent balance of potency (-10.55 kcal/mol) and drug-likeness (QED 0.73, logP 2.29). The protected indazole NH addresses metabolic stability concerns, and the addition of a polar acetamide group mitigates potential hERG liability.\n\n6. **MC:I2:N5:G1 (Rank #6)**: Similar to MC:I2:N4:G1, this molecule maintains a strong docking score (-10.56 kcal/mol) while reducing lipophilicity (logP 3.88). The hydroxyl group enhances H-bonding with Trp-80, a critical residue in the binding site.\n\n7. **MC:I2:N8:G1 (Rank #7)**: This molecule stands out for its exceptional drug-likeness (QED 0.82) and excellent interactions with all three critical residues (Thr-211, Asp-292, Trp-80). While its docking score (-9.2 kcal/mol) is lower than the top candidates, its balanced profile makes it a promising candidate.\n\n8. **MC:I2:N10:G1 (Rank #8)**: With excellent drug-likeness (QED 0.70) and very low lipophilicity (logP 1.99), this molecule offers a good balance of properties. Its docking score (-9.63 kcal/mol) is respectable, and it forms a critical salt bridge with Asp-292.\n\n9. **MC:I2:N7:G1 (Rank #9)**: This molecule offers excellent drug-likeness (QED 0.77) and forms key interactions with Thr-211 and Asp-292. Its docking score (-9.45 kcal/mol) is good but lower than the top candidates.\n\n10. **MC:I2:N6:G1 (Rank #10)**: With a very good docking score (-9.99 kcal/mol) and excellent synthetic accessibility (SA 2.83), this molecule rounds out our top 10. It forms a key H-bond with Thr-211 and has good drug-likeness properties.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe optimization efforts in Iteration 2 have successfully improved upon the lead compounds from Iteration 1. The top-ranked molecules demonstrate enhanced binding affinity, improved drug-like properties, and addressed potential metabolic liabilities. The hybrid approach (MC:I2:N1:G1) proved particularly successful, creating our most promising candidate with exceptional binding affinity and a balanced profile of properties.\n\nFor Iteration 3, I recommend focusing on further optimizing the top 5-7 compounds, with particular attention to:\n1. Fine-tuning the balance between potency and drug-likeness\n2. Exploring additional modifications to enhance selectivity\n3. Further addressing potential metabolic liabilities\n4. Creating additional hybrid molecules combining the most successful features'}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '# Scientific Critic\'s Review of Iteration 2 Progress\n\n## Overview Assessment\n\nI\'ve carefully analyzed the optimization strategies, molecular modifications, and ranking methodology employed during this iteration. While significant progress has been made in addressing the key objectives outlined by the Principal Researcher, several scientific concerns and potential pitfalls warrant critical examination.\n\n## Medicinal Chemistry Approach: Strengths and Limitations\n\n### Strengths in Molecular Design\n\nThe Medicinal Chemist has implemented rational modifications that address several key weaknesses identified in Iteration 1:\n\n1. **Metabolic Stability Improvements**: The N-methylation of indazole NH groups (e.g., in MC:I2:N1:G1, MC:I2:N2:G1, MC:I2:N3:G1) represents a sound strategy to block potential metabolic liabilities. This approach is well-established in medicinal chemistry literature.\n\n2. **Lipophilicity Reduction**: The introduction of polar groups (amides, hydroxyls) to reduce logP values in compounds like MC:I2:N4:G1 and MC:I2:N5:G1 is scientifically justified and addresses a critical weakness of the lead compound MC:I1:N3:G1.\n\n3. **Hybrid Design Strategy**: The creation of hybrid molecules combining favorable features from different scaffolds (particularly MC:I2:N1:G1) represents a creative and potentially valuable approach.\n\n### Scientific Concerns in Molecular Design\n\n1. **Potential Metabolic Liabilities Remain Unaddressed**:\n   \n   For MC:I2:N1:G1 (SMILES: `FC1=CC=C(S(=O)(=O)N2CCN(C(=O)C3=CC=C(CCC4=NC(C)NC5=C4C=CC=C5F)C=C3)CC2)C=C1`), the benzylic position in the CCC linker remains a potential metabolic liability. This position is susceptible to CYP-mediated oxidation, which could significantly reduce in vivo half-life. Consider replacing with metabolically more stable linkers such as cyclopropyl or introducing geminal dimethyl substitution.\n\n2. **Potential Toxicophores Introduced**:\n   \n   For MC:I2:N8:G1 (SMILES: `O=C1C=2C=C(NS(=O)(=O)C3=CC=C(F)C=C3F)SC=2C=C1N4CCN(C)CC4`), the thiophene-fused scaffold may present a bioactivation risk. Thiophenes can be oxidized to reactive metabolites (S-oxides and epoxides) that can form protein adducts, potentially leading to idiosyncratic toxicity. This risk should be acknowledged and potentially addressed in future iterations.\n\n3. **Insufficient Exploration of Bioisosteric Replacements**:\n   \n   While the modifications have been rational, there\'s limited exploration of classical bioisosteric replacements for key functional groups. For example, the sulfonamide group in MC:I2:N1:G1 could be replaced with bioisosteres like sulfamides, acylsulfonamides, or carboxylic acids to potentially improve properties while maintaining binding interactions.\n\n4. **Overreliance on N-Methylation**:\n   \n   The consistent use of N-methylation to protect metabolically vulnerable positions (particularly in indazoles) may introduce a systematic bias in the compound set. While scientifically sound, this approach doesn\'t explore alternative protection strategies like introducing nearby steric hindrance or electronic effects that could achieve the same goal without adding lipophilicity.\n\n## Docking and Scoring Methodology: Critical Analysis\n\n### Methodological Strengths\n\nThe consistent use of docking scores and PLIP interaction analysis provides a reasonable basis for comparing binding modes across compounds.\n\n### Scientific Concerns in Computational Approach\n\n1. **Single Protein Conformation Limitation**:\n   \n   All docking studies appear to use a single rigid conformation of AKT1 (PDB: 4EJN), which fails to account for protein flexibility. This is particularly concerning for kinases, which are known to adopt multiple conformations (DFG-in, DFG-out, etc.). The high docking scores for some compounds may be artificially favorable due to this limitation.\n\n2. **Potential Scoring Function Bias**:\n   \n   The docking scores show a potential bias toward larger, more lipophilic compounds. For example, MC:I2:N1:G1 (MW: 538.62, logP: 4.30) and MC:I2:N2:G1 (MW: 552.65, logP: 4.33) have the highest docking scores. This may reflect a known limitation of many scoring functions that overweight hydrophobic interactions.\n\n3. **Lack of Consideration for Water-Mediated Interactions**:\n   \n   The PLIP interaction analysis doesn\'t appear to account for water-mediated hydrogen bonds, which are often critical in kinase binding sites. This may lead to an incomplete understanding of the true binding modes.\n\n4. **Absence of Ensemble Docking or MD Validation**:\n   \n   There\'s no evidence of ensemble docking or molecular dynamics validation to confirm the stability of the proposed binding modes. This raises questions about the reliability of the predicted interactions, especially for novel scaffolds.\n\n## Ranking Methodology: Critical Evaluation\n\n### Strengths in Ranking Approach\n\nThe Ranking Agent has implemented a multi-parameter system that balances potency, interactions, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility, which is more comprehensive than relying solely on docking scores.\n\n### Scientific Concerns in Ranking\n\n1. **Subjective Weighting of Parameters**:\n   \n   The weighting system (30% docking score, 20% interactions, etc.) appears somewhat arbitrary and lacks scientific justification. Different weightings could significantly alter the rankings, raising questions about their robustness.\n\n2. **Inconsistent Evaluation of Metabolic Stability**:\n   \n   The assessment of "predicted metabolic stability" appears qualitative and inconsistent. For example, MC:I2:N5:G1 (SMILES: `CN1CCCCC1CC2=CC=C3C(=C2)CN(S(=O)(=O)C4=CC=C(O)C=C4F)C5=CC=CC=C5C3C(=O)N`) is noted as potentially having metabolic liability due to glucuronidation of the hydroxyl group, but similar concerns aren\'t raised for MC:I2:N6:G1 which also contains a phenolic hydroxyl.\n\n3. **Limited Consideration of Selectivity**:\n   \n   Despite being mentioned in the Principal Researcher\'s directives, selectivity considerations (particularly against AKT2/AKT3) are largely absent from the ranking criteria. This is a significant omission for kinase inhibitor development.\n\n4. **Overemphasis on Docking Score**:\n   \n   The 30% weighting for docking score may overemphasize a parameter with known limitations. Given the methodological concerns with docking noted above, this could skew rankings toward compounds with artificially favorable scores.\n\n## Specific Molecule Critiques\n\n1. **Top-Ranked Compound MC:I2:N1:G1**:\n   \n   SMILES: `FC1=CC=C(S(=O)(=O)N2CCN(C(=O)C3=CC=C(CCC4=NC(C)NC5=C4C=CC=C5F)C=C3)CC2)C=C1`\n   \n   While this compound shows excellent docking score (-11.42 kcal/mol), its molecular weight (538.62) exceeds the ideal range for oral bioavailability. The presence of both a sulfonamide and an amide group raises concerns about potential hERG liability, which wasn\'t addressed in the analysis. The benzylic linker (CCC) remains a metabolic liability.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N3:G1 vs. MC:I2:N2:G1 Comparison**:\n   \n   MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `O=C(C1=CC=C(CCC2=NC(C)N(C)C3=C2C=CC=C3F)C=C1)N4CCN(CC(=O)N)CC4`)\n   MC:I2:N2:G1 (SMILES: `O=C(C1=CC=C(CCC2=NC(C)N(C)C3=C2C=CC=C3F)C=C1)N4CCN(S(=O)(=O)C5=CC=C(F)C=C5)CC4`)\n   \n   These compounds share the same core but differ in their substituents. MC:I2:N3:G1 has significantly better drug-likeness (QED: 0.73 vs. 0.46) and lower logP (2.29 vs. 4.33), yet is ranked lower. This suggests potential inconsistency in the application of the ranking criteria or overemphasis on docking score.\n\n3. **Potential Synthetic Accessibility Concerns**:\n   \n   For MC:I2:N9:G1 (SMILES: `CCC1=C(O)C=CC=C1C2=CC=C3C(CCCCNC(=O)CC(=O)N)OCN=C32`), the SA score of 3.91 may underestimate synthetic challenges. The isochromenone scaffold with multiple substitutions presents potential regioselectivity issues during synthesis. This practical consideration should be acknowledged.\n\n## Scientific Gaps and Future Directions\n\n1. **Selectivity Assessment Remains Unaddressed**:\n   \n   Despite being highlighted as a key objective, there\'s no systematic approach to predicting or optimizing selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2/AKT3 isoforms. This represents a significant scientific gap that should be addressed in Iteration 3.\n\n2. **Limited Exploration of Structure-Activity Relationships**:\n   \n   The modifications, while rational, don\'t systematically explore SAR around key positions. A more methodical approach (e.g., scanning different substituents at specific positions) would provide more robust insights into the pharmacophore requirements.\n\n3. **Absence of Pharmacokinetic Considerations**:\n   \n   Beyond basic physicochemical properties, there\'s limited consideration of potential pharmacokinetic issues such as plasma protein binding, P-gp efflux, or blood-brain barrier penetration, which could be critical depending on the therapeutic application.\n\n4. **Need for Consensus Scoring or Alternative Validation**:\n   \n   Given the limitations of single-method docking, Iteration 3 would benefit from implementing consensus scoring approaches or alternative binding validation methods to increase confidence in the predicted binding modes.\n\n## Constructive Recommendations for Iteration 3\n\n1. **Implement Systematic SAR Exploration**:\n   \n   For the top 3-5 compounds, systematically explore modifications at key positions to develop more robust SAR understanding. This should include bioisosteric replacements of key functional groups.\n\n2. **Address Metabolic Stability More Comprehensively**:\n   \n   For MC:I2:N1:G1 and other top compounds, specifically address remaining metabolic liabilities such as benzylic positions and potentially problematic heterocycles.\n\n3. **Incorporate Selectivity Considerations**:\n   \n   Develop a computational approach to assess potential selectivity against AKT2/AKT3, possibly through comparative docking or focusing on interactions with non-conserved residues.\n\n4. **Validate Binding Modes Through Alternative Methods**:\n   \n   Implement consensus scoring, ensemble docking, or brief MD simulations to validate the stability of predicted binding modes for top compounds.\n\n5. **Balance Emphasis on Docking Scores**:\n   \n   Reconsider the weighting in the ranking system to reduce overreliance on docking scores and increase emphasis on drug-likeness and predicted ADME properties.\n\n6. **Explore Additional Scaffolds for Diversity**:\n   \n   While the current focus on optimizing top compounds is appropriate, maintaining some effort on exploring structurally distinct scaffolds would help mitigate the risk of systematic issues with the current chemical series.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIteration 2 has made significant progress in optimizing the lead compounds from Iteration 1, particularly in addressing lipophilicity concerns and metabolic liabilities. However, several scientific gaps and methodological limitations remain that should be addressed in Iteration 3. By implementing a more systematic approach to SAR exploration, addressing selectivity considerations, and validating binding modes through alternative methods, the team can further refine these promising AKT1 inhibitors toward compounds with balanced profiles of potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties.'}]
