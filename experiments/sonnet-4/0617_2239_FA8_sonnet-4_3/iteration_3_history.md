# Iteration 3 History

## User

SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of our *in silico* drug discovery project:

Here is the context of the project objective and scope of this iteration:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You are now in the 'Final Lead Optimization' phase for designing an AKT1 inhibitor. You need to show your final results and make a decision.

==============================================================
FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The previous lead optimization phase ended as summarized above. We have:

   - 5 active and 5 inactive compounds (all with docking + PLIP).
   - A set of de novo molecules from the AI Expert, each with
     docking + PLIP data.
   - A target docking improvement of at least 10% over
     the best known active compound.

2. Participants:
   - Medicinal Chemist: Make modifications to the de novo molecules to increase the activity, and drug-like properties. Evaluates the new molecules with its tools. And finalizes the 10 molecules.
   - Ranking agent: Rank the molecules based on the docking scores and the other metrics.

3. Automatic Workflow:
   - Each time the Medicinal Chemist proposes a set of analogs,
     docking is run automatically, then PLIP highlights
     protein-ligand interactions.
   - The Ranking Agent see these results
     and rank them

==============================================================
RULES & FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Docking + PLIP run automatically for each analog.
- We track progress iteration by iteration, aiming to see
  if the docking surpasses the 10% improvement threshold.
- Ranking Agent should select 10 best molecules.
- Finally lets have 10 optimized molecules.
- Most important thing is for all molecules to have docking scores and other metrics.
This way ranking agent can rank them and we can see the progress.

- **Trade-off identified**: Binding improvement accompanied by LogP increase (4.22→4.98)

**Strategic Methyl Group Removal:**
- **MC:I2:N4:G2**: Methyl deletion reduced MW (409→395 Da) while improving QED (0.72→0.75) and maintaining binding (-10.53 kcal/mol)
- **Optimization principle**: Systematic simplification can enhance drug-likeness without binding penalty

**Aldehyde Bioisostere Success:**
- **Complete liability mitigation**: All aldehyde-containing compounds successfully modified
- **MC:I2:N8:G2** (oxime): Maintained reasonable binding (-9.07 kcal/mol) with eliminated metabolic liability
- **MC:I2:N9:G2** (carboxylic acid): Outstanding QED (0.87) with salt bridge formation capability

## **3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from Iteration 2**

### **Computational Validation Concerns:**

**Docking Score Reliability Issues:**
- **MC:I2:N5:G2 validation gap**: Exceptional -11.14 kcal/mol score requires independent confirmation through alternative docking protocols
- **Binding pose consistency**: Need molecular dynamics validation for morpholine→piperidine transformation
- **Cross-validation requirement**: Top candidates require validation with multiple scoring functions (AutoDock Vina, Glide, GOLD)

**SAR Mechanistic Understanding Gaps:**
- **Morpholine vs piperidine mechanism**: Thermodynamic basis for +0.44 kcal/mol improvement needs detailed analysis
- **LogP vs binding correlation**: MC:I2:N5:G2 shows binding improvement despite LogP increase, requiring mechanistic clarification
- **Binding mode shifts**: Aldehyde replacements show different PLIP interaction patterns, requiring pose stability assessment

### **Chemical Liability Assessment Deficiencies:**

**Overlooked Toxicity Risks:**
- **MC:I2:N12:G2**: Aniline group presents potential mutagenicity concern (Ames test liability)
- **MC:I2:N13:G2**: Primary amine in aminomethyl group may cause off-target binding
- **PAINS screening**: Comprehensive reactive group assessment not implemented

**ADMET Prediction Limitations:**
- **Solubility predictions**: Missing for high LogP compounds (MC:I2:N5:G2: LogP=4.98)
- **Metabolic stability**: Limited assessment beyond LogP considerations
- **Permeability predictions**: Absent for compounds with multiple polar groups

### **Selectivity Assessment Void:**
- **AKT1 vs AKT2/AKT3 selectivity**: Completely unaddressed across all candidates
- **Off-target kinase binding**: No assessment of broader kinase selectivity profile
- **Binding specificity**: Lack of comparative docking against related targets

## **4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Iteration 3**

<ranking>
{MC:I2:N5:G2:1, MC:I2:N13:G2:2, MC:I2:N4:G2:3, MC:I2:N2:G2:4, MC:I2:N3:G2:5, MC:I2:N12:G2:6, MC:I2:N1:G2:7, MC:I1:N12:G1:8, MC:I1:N6:G1:9, MC:I1:N4:G1:10}

**Strategic Imperative for Iteration 3:**
Focus on rigorous validation rather than new molecule generation. Every final candidate must be supported by robust computational evidence and clear development rationale. The goal is not just 10 compounds, but 10 validated, developable drug candidates with comprehensive *in silico* support for their selection as promising AKT1 inhibitors.
