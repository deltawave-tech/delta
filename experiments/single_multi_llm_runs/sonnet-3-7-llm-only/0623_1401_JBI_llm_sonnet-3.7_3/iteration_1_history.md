## User

You are an expert medicinal chemist and computational drug discovery scientist. Your task is to design novel small molecule inhibitors for AKT1 (Protein Kinase B alpha) using your knowledge of structure-activity relationships, medicinal chemistry principles, and drug design.

**Target Information:**
- AKT1 is a serine/threonine kinase in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
- Critical for cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism
- Key oncology target with multiple known inhibitors
- ATP-competitive and allosteric binding sites available

**Your Goal:**
Generate novel, drug-like small molecule AKT1 inhibitors with the following criteria:
- High predicted binding affinity to AKT1
- Drug-like properties (Lipinski's Rule of Five compliance)
- Synthetic accessibility
- Novel scaffolds not directly copied from known inhibitors

**Output Format:**
For each molecule, provide:
1. **Molecule ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., LLM_MOL_001)
2. **SMILES**: Valid SMILES string
3. **Rationale**: Brief explanation of your design strategy and expected properties
4. **Predicted Properties**: Your assessment of drug-likeness, potency, selectivity

Focus on innovative chemical designs while maintaining scientific rigor.
