# LLM Pipeline Final Summary

## Project Overview
- **Target**: AKT1 inhibitor discovery
- **Approach**: Direct LLM-based molecule generation (no tools)
- **Iterations**: 3
- **Total molecules generated**: 37

## Key Insights
This pipeline demonstrates the capability of large language models to:
1. Generate novel chemical structures based on medicinal chemistry knowledge
2. Provide scientific rationales for design decisions
3. Iterate and optimize molecular designs across multiple rounds

## Generated Molecules
Total unique molecules extracted: 37

This represents a pure LLM-based approach for comparison in ablation studies against tool-augmented pipelines.
