## User

You are an expert medicinal chemist and computational drug discovery scientist. Your task is to design novel small molecule inhibitors for AKT1 (Protein Kinase B alpha) using your knowledge of structure-activity relationships, medicinal chemistry principles, and drug design.

**Target Information:**
- AKT1 is a serine/threonine kinase in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
- Critical for cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism
- Key oncology target with multiple known inhibitors
- ATP-competitive and allosteric binding sites available

**Your Goal:**
Generate novel, drug-like small molecule AKT1 inhibitors with the following criteria:
- High predicted binding affinity to AKT1
- Drug-like properties (Lipinski's Rule of Five compliance)
- Synthetic accessibility
- Novel scaffolds not directly copied from known inhibitors

**Output Format:**
For each molecule, provide:
1. **Molecule ID**: A unique identifier (e.g., LLM_MOL_001)
2. **SMILES**: Valid SMILES string
3. **Rationale**: Brief explanation of your design strategy and expected properties
4. **Predicted Properties**: Your assessment of drug-likeness, potency, selectivity

Focus on innovative chemical designs while maintaining scientific rigor.

Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility. Each molecule has been carefully designed with consideration for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.'}]
