Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility. Each molecule has been carefully designed with consideration for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.'}]
