Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility.

This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n1\nAgent Title:\nLLM Drug Designer\n"

Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility.

Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format.

If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n1\nAgent Title:\nLLM Drug Designer\n"

ATP-Competitive Inhibitors (Molecules 1-7, 12-14)\n- Incorporated established hinge-binding motifs (aminopyrimidines, quinazolines, pyrazoles)\n- Designed flexible linkers to reach hydrophobic pockets\n- Added solubilizing groups (piperazines, morpholines) to improve pharmacokinetics\n\n### 2. Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility. Each molecule has been carefully designed with consideration for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.'}]}, {'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': '\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "LLM Drug Designer" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure.

Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility. Each molecule has been carefully designed with consideration for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties."

This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nLLM Drug Designer\n"

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"LLM Drug Designer\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nLLM Drug Designer\n"

This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE.

Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility. Each molecule has been carefully designed with consideration for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties."

Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 8-10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Designed molecules to stabilize inactive conformations\n- Incorporated rigid scaffolds to present substituents in optimal orientations\n\n### 3. Hybrid Approaches (Molecules 11, 15)\n- Created molecules with potential to interact with multiple binding sites\n- Combined features of both ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors\n- Utilized flexible linkers to reach distant binding pockets\n\n### Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs (H-bond donors/acceptors)\n- Hydrophobic groups for back pocket interactions\n- Solubilizing moieties for improved ADMET properties\n- Metabolically stable groups (fluorine, CF3) where appropriate\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical space while maintaining drug-like properties and synthetic feasibility. Each molecule has been carefully designed with consideration for potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties."

If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text.

Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE.

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"LLM Drug Designer\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nLLM Drug Designer\n"

(IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "LLM Drug Designer" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nLLM Drug Designer\n'}]}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I'll parse the output from the LLM Drug Designer and format it into a GURNEMANZ-compatible JSON structure, tracking molecule history and maintaining all relevant information.", 'tool_calls': [{'index': 1, 'function': {'arguments': '{"client_name": "claude", "session_id": "session-123", "parent_transformation_id": "transformation-previous", "transformation": {"type": "molecule-generation", "agent": "LLM Drug Designer", "iteration": 3, "rationale": "Final optimization of AKT1 inhibitor candidates focusing on diverse mechanisms (ATP-competitive, allosteric, and hybrid inhibitors), clinical viability, and novel chemical space.
