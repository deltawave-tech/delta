ATP-Competitive Inhibitors (Molecules 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)\n- Incorporated established kinase hinge-binding motifs (pyrimidine, purine, thiazole, quinazoline, imidazole)\n- Designed appropriate substituents to occupy hydrophobic pockets\n- Included solubilizing groups positioned to interact with solvent-exposed regions\n\n### 2. Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 2, 10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Incorporated features to stabilize the inactive conformation\n- Designed molecules to prevent membrane recruitment and activation\n\n### 3. Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs for ATP-competitive inhibitors\n- Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors in optimal positions\n- Hydrophobic groups to occupy lipophilic pockets\n- Solubilizing groups (morpholine, piperazine) to improve physicochemical properties\n\n### 4. Drug-Likeness Considerations\n- Maintained appropriate molecular weight (typically <500 Da)\n- Limited hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (Lipinski compliant)\n- Balanced lipophilicity for membrane permeability and solubility\n- Incorporated metabolic stability features (e.g., fluorine substitution)\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical scaffolds with potential for AKT1 inhibition while maintaining drug-like properties. They provide a strong foundation for further optimization in subsequent iterations.'}]
