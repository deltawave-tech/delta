Allosteric Inhibitors (Molecules 2, 10)\n- Targeted the PH domain-kinase domain interface\n- Incorporated features to stabilize the inactive conformation\n- Designed molecules to prevent membrane recruitment and activation\n\n### 3. Key Pharmacophore Elements\n- Hinge-binding motifs for ATP-competitive inhibitors\n- Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors in optimal positions\n- Hydrophobic groups to occupy lipophilic pockets\n- Solubilizing groups (morpholine, piperazine) to improve physicochemical properties\n\n### 4. Drug-Likeness Considerations\n- Maintained appropriate molecular weight (typically <500 Da)\n- Limited hydrogen bond donors and acceptors (Lipinski compliant)\n- Balanced lipophilicity for membrane permeability and solubility\n- Incorporated metabolic stability features (e.g., fluorine substitution)\n\nThese designs represent diverse chemical scaffolds with potential for AKT1 inhibition while maintaining drug-like properties. They provide a strong foundation for further optimization in subsequent iterations.'}]

Here\'s a summary of the key optimization strategies applied:\n\n### 1. Metabolic Stability Enhancements\n- **Strategic fluorination**: Added fluorine atoms to block metabolic soft spots (molecules AI:I2:N9:G1, AI:I2:N10:G1, AI:I2:N11:G1)\n- **Bioisosteric replacements**: Substituted oxadiazole with thiadiazole (AI:I2:N5:G1) and morpholine with thiomorpholine (AI:I2:N3:G1)\n- **Metabolically robust groups**: Replaced trifluoroacetamide with cyclopropanecarboxamide (AI:I2:N7:G1)\n\n### 2. Solubility Improvements\n- **Reduced lipophilicity**: Removed fluorine atoms (AI:I2:N2:G1) and replaced N-methylpiperazine with piperazine (AI:I2:N4:G1)\n- **Enhanced hydrogen bonding**: Introduced pyrrole N-H as additional H-bond donor (AI:I2:N1:G1)\n- **Ring size modifications**: Replaced morpholine with oxazepane (AI:I2:N12:G1)\n\n### 3. Selectivity Enhancements\n- **Exploiting binding pocket differences**: Modified hinge-binding elements to better interact with AKT1-specific residues\n- **Conformational constraints**: Introduced groups that can form specific interactions with AKT1 over AKT2/3\n- **Strategic substitutions**: Positioned substituents to interact with non-conserved residues\n\n### 4. Potency Optimization\n- **Enhanced binding interactions**: Added groups capable of forming additional H-bonds or multipolar interactions\n- **Hydrophobic pocket targeting**: Optimized substituents for better fit in hydrophobic pockets (AI:I2:N6:G1)\n- **Maintained key pharmacophores**: Preserved essential binding elements while modifying peripheral groups\n\nThese optimized molecules represent a significant advancement over the initial designs, with improved drug-like properties, potential for enhanced selectivity, and better ADMET profiles. The modifications were guided by established medicinal chemistry principles and structure-activity relationship considerations.'}]
