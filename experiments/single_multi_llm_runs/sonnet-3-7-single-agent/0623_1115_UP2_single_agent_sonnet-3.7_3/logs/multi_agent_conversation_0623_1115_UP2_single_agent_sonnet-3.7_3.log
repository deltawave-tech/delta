This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)", 'domain': ['Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173).

AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at \'Ser-50\' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at \'Ser-21\' and GSK3B at \'Ser-9\', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of \'Ser-83\' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at \'Ser-939\' and \'Thr-1462\', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at \'Thr-24\', \'Ser-256\' and \'Ser-319\' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates \'Ser-454\' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of \'Ser-273\', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on \'Ser-318\', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at \'Thr-120\' and \'Thr-387\' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at \'Thr-117\' and \'Thr-384\' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at \'Ser-259\' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at \'Thr-369\' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at \'Thr-145\' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at \'Ser-90\', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)", "domain": ["Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

Gathered comprehensive information on AKT1 structure, function, and regulation\n2. Retrieved a high-quality 3D structure (PDB: 4EJN) for molecular docking\n3. Identified known active and inactive AKT1 inhibitors from ChEMBL\n4. Generated diverse de novo molecules targeting AKT1\n5. Evaluated binding affinity and drug-like properties of all compounds\n6.

Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n1\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n1\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Gathered comprehensive information on AKT1 structure, function, and regulation\n2. Retrieved a high-quality 3D structure (PDB: 4EJN) for molecular docking\n3. Identified known active and inactive AKT1 inhibitors from ChEMBL\n4. Generated diverse de novo molecules targeting AKT1\n5. Evaluated binding affinity and drug-like properties of all compounds\n6. Selected 8 promising scaffolds for further optimization\n\n## Key Structural Insights\n\n1. **Binding Site Characteristics**:\n   - The ATP-binding pocket of AKT1 contains key residues: TRP80, THR211, SER205, ASP292, LEU210, LEU264, VAL270, and TYR272\n   - Pi-stacking interactions with TRP80 appear in most high-affinity binders\n   - Hydrogen bonding with ASP292, THR211, and SER205 is common in potent inhibitors\n\n2. **Pharmacophore Features**:\n   - Aromatic rings that can form pi-stacking with TRP80\n   - Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors to interact with ASP292, THR211, and SER205\n   - Hydrophobic groups to interact with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270\n   - Basic nitrogen atoms that can form salt bridges with ASP292\n\n3. **Structure-Activity Relationships**:\n   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have better binding scores\n   - Compounds with hydrogen bond donors/acceptors in specific positions show improved binding\n   - Molecules with moderate lipophilicity (LogP 2.5-4.5) generally perform better\n\n## Directives for Iteration 2\n\nIn the next iteration, I will focus on optimizing the most promising scaffolds identified in Iteration 1. The primary objectives will be:\n\n1. **Scaffold Prioritization**:\n   - Focus on the top 3-4 scaffolds: AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, and AI:I1:N5:G0\n   - Design 3-4 analogs for each scaffold to explore structure-activity relationships\n\n2. **Structural Modifications**:\n   - Optimize hydrogen bonding interactions with ASP292, THR211, and SER205\n   - Enhance pi-stacking interactions with TRP80\n   - Improve hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270\n   - Fine-tune physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED, SA) for better drug-likeness\n\n3. **Specific Modifications to Explore**:\n   - For AI:I1:N1:G0: Modify the isopropoxy group to improve hydrogen bonding\n   - For AI:I1:N3:G0: Explore different substituents on the thiazole ring\n   - For AI:I1:N4:G0: Optimize the sulfonamide group position and substitution\n   - For AI:I1:N5:G0: Explore bioisosteres of the carboxylic acid group\n\n4. **Property Optimization Targets**:\n   - Maintain QED > 0.5\n   - Keep LogP between 2.0-5.0\n   - Maintain synthetic accessibility (SA) < 4.0\n   - Keep molecular weight < 500 Da\n\nBy systematically exploring these modifications, I aim to identify compounds with improved binding affinity and drug-like properties in Iteration 2."}]}, {'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': '\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "One Person Biotech" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE.

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 2 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project. The primary goals were to gather comprehensive data on AKT1, identify known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and evaluate their binding affinity and drug-like properties. I successfully generated and evaluated multiple promising scaffolds with binding affinities comparable to or better than known inhibitors, establishing a solid foundation for lead optimization in Iteration 2.\n\n## 2.

Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process . Please maintain this role throughout our conversation.\n\n\n        \"molecules\": [\n                {\n                    \"smiles\": \"SMILES_STRING\",\n                    \"friendly_id\": \"friendly id of molecule eg: DA:I1:N0:G0\",\n                    \"source\": \"(parent molecule id of modified molecule)\"\n                    \"agent\": \"AGENT_NAME\",\n                    \"rationale\": \"(rationale for the molecule)\"\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n        </molecules>\n        \nDruing the discovery process, molecules will be presented with a friendly_id. This friendly_id is a unique identifier that tracks its complete history and lineage through our optimization process to help to follow the SAR and parent-child relationships.\n\n## Molecule ID System - Tracking Molecular Evolution\n\nEach molecule receives a unique identifier that tracks its complete history and lineage through our optimization process.\n\n**Format:** `AgentCode:I<iteration>:N<position>:G<generation>`\n\nThis ID (friendly_id) system serves as a molecular genealogy, allowing us to:\n- Track which agent created or modified each molecule\n- Understand the evolutionary path from original to optimized compounds\n- Maintain parent-child relationships across modifications\n\n**Components:**\n- **AgentCode**: Two-letter code representing the creator agent\n  - DA = Database Agent\n  - AI = AI Expert\n  - MC = Medicinal Chemist\n  - LA = Literature Agent\n  - RA = Ranking Agent\n  - PR = Principal Researcher\n  - SC = Scientific Critic\n  - SP = Summary Parser\n\n- **I<iteration>**: The research iteration number when molecule was introduced (e.g., I1, I2, I3)\n- **N<position>**: The molecule's position in the agent's output list, starting from N1 (resets per agent output)\n- **G<generation>**: The modification depth showing molecular evolution\n  - G0 = original molecule (from database or de novo)\n  - G1 = first modification\n  - G2 = second modification\n  - And so on...\n\n**Example Evolution:**\n1. Database retrieves: `DA:I1:N3:G0` (original from ChEMBL, third molecule in list, iteration 1)\n2. Medicinal Chemist modifies it: `MC:I2:N1:G1` (first modification, first molecule in chemist's list, iteration 2)\n3. Further optimization: `MC:I3:N2:G2` (second modification, second molecule in list, iteration 3)\n\nThis allows us to trace any molecule back to its origins and understand its optimization journey.\nIf a molecule is a child of a parent molecule, the parent molecule's friendly_id must be included in the molecule's source field\n"

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:", role='assistant', tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(index=1, function=Function(arguments='{"protein_path": "/Users/atabeyunlu/multi_agent_paper/runs_metadata/0623_1115_UP2_single_agent_sonnet-3.7_3/pdb_files/cleaned_4EJN.pdb", "molecules": ["CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N", "CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N", "CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N"]}', name='vina_report'), id='toolu_01RareDpiThqQie1V9nPyfwz', type='function')], function_call=None, provider_specific_fields={'citations': []}, citations=[]))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=1231, prompt_tokens=7441, total_tokens=8672, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetailsWrapper(audio_tokens=None, cached_tokens=0, text_tokens=None, image_tokens=None), cache_creation_input_tokens=0, cache_read_input_tokens=0))

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

    "content": "# Iteration 2: AKT1 Inhibitor Optimization\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on my previous iteration's findings, I'll focus on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds through medicinal chemistry modifications to:\n\n1. Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

    "content": "# Iteration 2: AKT1 Inhibitor Optimization\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on my previous iteration's findings, I'll focus on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds through medicinal chemistry modifications to:\n\n1. Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project. The primary goals were to gather comprehensive data on AKT1, identify known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and evaluate their binding affinity and drug-like properties. I successfully generated and evaluated multiple promising scaffolds with binding affinities comparable to or better than known inhibitors, establishing a solid foundation for lead optimization in Iteration 2.\n\n## 2.

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process . Please maintain this role throughout our conversation.\n\n\n        \"molecules\": [\n                {\n                    \"smiles\": \"SMILES_STRING\",\n                    \"friendly_id\": \"friendly id of molecule eg: DA:I1:N0:G0\",\n                    \"source\": \"(parent molecule id of modified molecule)\"\n                    \"agent\": \"AGENT_NAME\",\n                    \"rationale\": \"(rationale for the molecule)\"\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n        </molecules>\n        \nDruing the discovery process, molecules will be presented with a friendly_id.

Database retrieves: `DA:I1:N3:G0` (original from ChEMBL, third molecule in list, iteration 1)\n2. Medicinal Chemist modifies it: `MC:I2:N1:G1` (first modification, first molecule in chemist's list, iteration 2)\n3. Further optimization: `MC:I3:N2:G2` (second modification, second molecule in list, iteration 3)\n\nThis allows us to trace any molecule back to its origins and understand its optimization journey.\nIf a molecule is a child of a parent molecule, the parent molecule's friendly_id must be included in the molecule's source field\n"

    "content": "# Iteration 2: AKT1 Inhibitor Optimization\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on my previous iteration's findings, I'll focus on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds through medicinal chemistry modifications to:\n\n1. Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

    "content": "# Iteration 2: AKT1 Inhibitor Optimization\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on my previous iteration's findings, I'll focus on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds through medicinal chemistry modifications to:\n\n1. Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:",

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:", 'tool_calls':

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:"

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:"

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:"

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "One Person Biotech" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n'}]}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I'll parse the output from the One Person Biotech agent and format it into a GURNEMANZ JSON structure, tracking molecule history and ensuring all required fields are included.", 'tool_calls': [{'index': 1, 'function': {'arguments': '{"session_id": "0623_1115_UP2_single_agent_sonnet-3.7_3", "parent_transformation_id": "iteration_1", "transformation": {"type": "lead-optimization", "agent": "One Person Biotech", "iteration": 2, "rationale": "Systematic optimization of the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications to improve binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted selectivity.

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:"

Improve binding affinity to AKT1\n2. Enhance drug-like properties\n3. Maintain synthetic feasibility\n4. Develop structure-activity relationships\n\nSpecifically, I'll:\n- Design 3-4 analogs for each of the top 4 scaffolds (AI:I1:N1:G0, AI:I1:N3:G0, AI:I1:N4:G0, AI:I1:N5:G0)\n- Evaluate all new analogs with VINA_REPORT\n- Analyze emerging SAR patterns\n- Select the most promising 6-8 compounds for further optimization in Iteration 3\n\n## Clarifying Remarks\n\nFor this iteration, I'll apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications rather than using AI generation. Each modification will target specific structural features identified in Iteration 1 as important for binding, while maintaining or improving drug-like properties. I'll focus on:\n\n- Optimizing key interaction points with AKT1 (TRP80, ASP292, THR211, SER205)\n- Improving physicochemical properties (LogP, MW, QED)\n- Maintaining synthetic accessibility\n\n## Beginning Scaffold 1 Optimization (AI:I1:N1:G0)\n\nI'll start by designing modifications to our top-scoring compound AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), which had an excellent docking score of -10.42 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for Scaffold 1:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1**: Replace the isopropoxy group with morpholine to improve H-bonding and reduce lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The morpholine group can serve as both H-bond acceptor and donor, potentially forming additional interactions with the binding site while reducing LogP.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a 2,3-dichlorophenyl group to maintain pi-stacking while reducing lipophilicity\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(OC(C)C)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=CC(Cl)=C3Cl)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The 2,3-dichlorophenyl group can maintain pi-stacking with TRP80 while reducing the molecular weight and lipophilicity compared to naphthalene.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1**: Add a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring to enhance H-bonding with ASP292\n   * **SMILES**: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`\n   * **Source**: AI:I1:N1:G0\n   * **Rationale**: The carboxamide group can form additional H-bonds with ASP292 and other polar residues in the binding site, potentially improving binding affinity.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using VINA_REPORT:"

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties.

What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration

## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration

In Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.

2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.

3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.

4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).

   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding

## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration

### Challenges
1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.

2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.

3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.

4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.

### Unresolved Questions
1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?

2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.

3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?

4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?

5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?

## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:", role='assistant', tool_calls=[ChatCompletionMessageToolCall(index=1, function=Function(arguments='{"protein_path": "/Users/atabeyunlu/multi_agent_paper/runs_metadata/0623_1115_UP2_single_agent_sonnet-3.7_3/pdb_files/cleaned_4EJN.pdb", "molecules": ["CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4N=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N", "CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C(N4CCOCC4)C=C3)NC1N", "CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(S(=O)(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N"]}', name='vina_report'), id='toolu_01TmUyHKfFXwGmdewVPkXjkn', type='function')], function_call=None, provider_specific_fields={'citations': []}, citations=[]))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=810, prompt_tokens=11078, total_tokens=11888, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetailsWrapper(audio_tokens=None, cached_tokens=0, text_tokens=None, image_tokens=None), cache_creation_input_tokens=0, cache_read_input_tokens=0))

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration\n\n### a. Overarching Goal for Next Iteration\nRefine and optimize the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications to improve their drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity, resulting in a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates.\n\n### b.

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2.

What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:",

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process . Please maintain this role throughout our conversation.\n\n\n        \"molecules\": [\n                {\n                    \"smiles\": \"SMILES_STRING\",\n                    \"friendly_id\": \"friendly id of molecule eg: DA:I1:N0:G0\",\n                    \"source\": \"(parent molecule id of modified molecule)\"\n                    \"agent\": \"AGENT_NAME\",\n                    \"rationale\": \"(rationale for the molecule)\"\n                }\n            ],\n        }\n        </molecules>\n        \nDruing the discovery process, molecules will be presented with a friendly_id.

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2.

What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:",

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration\n\n### a. Overarching Goal for Next Iteration\nRefine and optimize the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications to improve their drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity, resulting in a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates.\n\n### b.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:",

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration\n\n### a. Overarching Goal for Next Iteration\nRefine and optimize the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications to improve their drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity, resulting in a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates.\n\n### b.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:",

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration\n\n### a. Overarching Goal for Next Iteration\nRefine and optimize the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications to improve their drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity, resulting in a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates.\n\n### b.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:",

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds.

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:",

Optimizing the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improving drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity\n3. Creating hybrid structures that combine beneficial features from different scaffolds\n4. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with optimal balance of potency and properties\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nIn this final iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to:\n- Reduce lipophilicity while maintaining key binding interactions\n- Replace bulky groups with smaller bioisosteres to improve drug-likeness\n- Add strategic polar groups to enhance solubility\n- Create hybrid molecules that combine the best features of our top scaffolds\n- Ensure all final candidates meet our KPIs: docking scores < -10.0 kcal/mol (for at least 5 compounds), QED > 0.6, LogP between 2.0-4.0, and MW < 450 Da\n\n## Task 1: Optimize MC:I2:N3:G1 (Top Compound)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top compound MC:I2:N3:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`), focusing on:\n\n1. **Analog 1**: Replace the naphthalene ring with a smaller aromatic system (quinoline) to improve QED while maintaining pi-stacking with TRP80\n2. **Analog 2**: Add a polar morpholine group to enhance solubility while preserving key H-bonding interactions\n3. **Analog 3**: Replace the carboxamide with a sulfonamide bioisostere to maintain binding while potentially improving properties\n\nLet me evaluate these analogs using VINA_REPORT:", 'tool_calls': [{'index': 1, 'function': {'arguments': '{"protein_path":

Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2.

What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 3 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it's challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn't address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we've made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it\'s challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn\'t address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we\'ve made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration\n\n### a. Overarching Goal for Next Iteration\nRefine and optimize the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications to improve their drug-like properties (particularly QED and predicted ADMET profiles) while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity, resulting in a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates.\n\n### b.

(IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "One Person Biotech" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n'}]}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I'll parse the output from the One Person Biotech agent and format it into a GURNEMANZ-compatible JSON structure, tracking molecule history and ensuring all required fields are included.", 'tool_calls': [{'index': 1, 'function': {'arguments': '{"client_name": "claude", "session_id": "0623_1115_UP2_single_agent_sonnet-3.7_3", "parent_transformation_id": "previous_transformation_id", "transformation": {"type": "molecule-generation", "agent": "One Person Biotech", "iteration": 3, "rationale": "Final optimization of the top 6 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications to improve drug-like properties while maintaining or enhancing binding affinity.

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds.

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on systematically optimizing the top 4 scaffolds from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications. The primary goals were to improve binding affinity, enhance drug-like properties, maintain synthetic feasibility, and develop structure-activity relationships. I successfully designed and evaluated 13 modified compounds, with several showing significant improvements in binding affinity and physicochemical properties compared to their parent scaffolds. Most notably, the addition of a carboxamide group to our top scaffold (AI:I1:N1:G0) resulted in a compound (MC:I2:N3:G1) with exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol) and improved drug-like properties. This iteration has provided valuable SAR insights and identified several promising candidates for further optimization in Iteration 3.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### Successful Scaffold Modifications\n1. **Carboxamide Addition (MC:I2:N3:G1)**: Adding a carboxamide group to the para position of the phenyl ring in AI:I1:N1:G0 resulted in exceptional binding affinity (-11.22 kcal/mol), significantly reduced LogP (2.80 vs. 4.49), and formed multiple H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Fluorinated Derivative (MC:I2:N13:G2)**: Adding a fluorine atom to the naphthalene ring of MC:I2:N3:G1 maintained excellent binding (-10.24 kcal/mol) while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n3. **Morpholine Substitution (MC:I2:N1:G1)**: Replacing the isopropoxy group with morpholine maintained excellent binding (-10.31 kcal/mol) while reducing LogP (3.54 vs. 4.49) and forming additional H-bonds with THR291, ASP292, TYR326, and THR82.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere (MC:I2:N10:G1)**: Replacing the carboxylic acid in AI:I1:N5:G0 with a tetrazole improved binding affinity (-9.82 kcal/mol vs. -8.9 kcal/mol) while maintaining similar acidic properties and reducing LogP (2.95 vs. 3.67).\n\n### Top Molecular Candidates\n1. **MC:I2:N3:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -11.22 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.57\n   * **LogP**: 2.80\n   * **MW**: 370.46\n\n2. **MC:I2:N13:G2** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(C(=O)N)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=C(F)C=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.24 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.55\n   * **LogP**: 2.94\n   * **MW**: 388.45\n\n3. **MC:I2:N1:G1** (SMILES: `CNC1=C(C2=CC=C(N3CCOCC3)C=C2)C=C(C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C3)NC1N`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -10.31 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 3.54\n   * **MW**: 412.54\n\n4. **MC:I2:N10:G1** (SMILES: `C1=NN=NN1C2=CC=C(N3C=C(NC4=CC=CC=C4Cl)N=N3)C=C2C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.82 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.61\n   * **LogP**: 2.95\n   * **MW**: 352.79\n\n5. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (SMILES: `C=C1C=C(C2=NN=C3SC(C(=O)N)=CC3=C2CCC)CC1C`)\n   * **Docking Score**: -9.57 kcal/mol\n   * **QED**: 0.93\n   * **LogP**: 3.72\n   * **MW**: 313.43\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationships (SAR)\n1. **Carboxamide Group**: Addition of a carboxamide group significantly improved binding affinity in both Scaffold 1 and Scaffold 2, likely due to additional H-bonding opportunities with SER205, THR211, and THR291.\n\n2. **Morpholine Substitution**: Replacing hydrophobic groups (isopropoxy, propyl) with morpholine maintained good binding while improving solubility and reducing LogP.\n\n3. **Fluorine Addition**: Strategic addition of fluorine atoms maintained binding affinity while potentially improving metabolic stability.\n\n4. **Tetrazole Bioisostere**: Replacing carboxylic acid with tetrazole improved binding affinity while maintaining similar acidic properties.\n\n5. **Key Binding Interactions**:\n   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding\n   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds\n   - Hydrophobic interactions with LEU210, LEU264, and VAL270 contribute to binding stability\n\n6. **Optimal Properties**:\n   - LogP between 2.8-3.8 appears optimal for binding\n   - Compounds with multiple aromatic rings and H-bond donors/acceptors show improved binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Challenges\n1. **QED Optimization**: While we improved LogP values, some of our top compounds (MC:I2:N3:G1, MC:I2:N13:G2) still have QED values below 0.6, indicating room for improvement in overall drug-likeness.\n\n2. **Balancing Potency and Properties**: Modifications that improved binding affinity sometimes negatively impacted other drug-like properties, highlighting the challenge of multi-parameter optimization.\n\n3. **Scaffold 3 Modifications**: Our modifications to Scaffold 3 (AI:I1:N4:G0) generally resulted in reduced binding affinity, suggesting this scaffold may be less amenable to optimization.\n\n4. **Binding Mode Consistency**: Without visual analysis of binding poses, it\'s challenging to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Assessment**: Current evaluation doesn\'t address selectivity against other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3. What structural features might enhance selectivity for AKT1?\n\n2. **Metabolic Stability**: While we\'ve made modifications that might improve metabolic stability (e.g., fluorination), we lack specific predictions of metabolic stability for our compounds.\n\n3. **Pharmacophore Definition**: What is the minimal pharmacophore required for AKT1 inhibition based on our current data? Can we define a comprehensive pharmacophore model?\n\n4. **Optimal Balance**: What is the optimal balance between binding affinity, drug-like properties, and predicted ADMET profiles for AKT1 inhibitors?\n\n5. **Hybrid Potential**: Could hybrid structures combining features from different scaffolds yield compounds with superior properties?\n\n## 4.

2. **Systematic Optimization Process**: Implemented a methodical three-iteration approach that progressed from initial AI-generated molecules to highly optimized candidates through strategic medicinal chemistry modifications, resulting in compounds with significantly improved binding affinity and drug-like properties.

3. **Critical SAR Insights**: Developed comprehensive structure-activity relationships for AKT1 inhibition, identifying that:
   - H-bonds with SER205, THR211, and ASP292 are critical for high-affinity binding
   - Pi-stacking with TRP80 is present in most high-scoring compounds
   - Carboxamide and sulfonamide groups significantly enhance binding affinity
   - Morpholine substituents improve solubility while maintaining binding affinity
   - Fluorine substitution enhances metabolic stability without compromising binding

4. **Substantial Binding Affinity Improvements**: Enhanced binding affinity from initial compounds (best score -10.42 kcal/mol) to our top final candidate (-11.94 kcal/mol), representing a significant improvement in predicted potency.

5. **Multi-Parameter Optimization**: Successfully balanced multiple parameters (binding affinity, drug-likeness, physicochemical properties) to develop well-rounded candidates, with our best compounds showing excellent binding while maintaining favorable QED, LogP, and molecular weight values.

6. **Hybrid Molecule Creation**: Developed innovative hybrid structures combining beneficial features from different scaffolds, resulting in compounds with superior overall profiles compared to their parent molecules.

7. **Diverse Chemical Space Exploration**: Explored diverse chemical space through both AI generation and medicinal chemistry modifications, resulting in a structurally diverse set of final candidates that maintain high predicted activity.

### b. *In Silico* Limitations & Challenges Encountered

1. **Docking Score Reliability**: Reliance on docking scores as the primary measure of binding affinity, without validation through more sophisticated methods like molecular dynamics simulations or free energy calculations, potentially limiting the accuracy of our potency predictions.

2. **Selectivity Assessment Limitations**: Inability to directly assess selectivity against related kinases (particularly AKT2 and AKT3) within our computational workflow, leaving uncertainty about the potential for off-target effects.

3. **ADMET Prediction Constraints**: Limited ability to predict comprehensive ADMET properties beyond basic physicochemical parameters (QED, LogP, MW), potentially overlooking important pharmacokinetic or toxicity issues.

4. **Binding Mode Visualization Challenges**: Lack of visual analysis tools for binding poses made it difficult to confirm whether all compounds bind in a similar orientation or if there are multiple viable binding modes.

5. **Synthetic Feasibility Assessment**: While we considered synthetic accessibility conceptually, we lacked quantitative metrics to assess the synthetic feasibility of our designed compounds.

6. **QED Optimization Challenges**: Difficulty in simultaneously optimizing binding affinity and QED, with some of our highest-affinity compounds still showing QED values below ideal ranges.

7. **Parameter Balancing Trade-offs**: Consistent challenge in balancing multiple parameters, where modifications that improved one property (e.g., binding affinity) sometimes negatively impacted others (e.g., drug-likeness).
