This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)", 'domain': ['Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity). The PH domain mediates interaction with TNK2 and Tyr-176 is also essential for this interaction (PubMed:20333297)\", \"The AGC-kinase C-terminal mediates interaction with THEM4\"], \"sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYKERPQDVDQREAPLNNFSVAQCQLMKTERPRPNTFIIRCLQWTTVIERTFHVETPEEREEWTTAIQTVADGLKKQEEEEMDFRSGSPSDNSGAEEMEVSLAKPKHRVTMNEFEYLKLLGKGTFGKVILVKEKATGRYYAMKILKKEVIVAKDEVAHTLTENRVLQNSRHPFLTALKYSFQTHDRLCFVMEYANGGELFFHLSRERVFSEDRARFYGAEIVSALDYLHSEKNVVYRDLKLENLMLDKDGHIKITDFGLCKEGIKDGATMKTFCGTPEYLAPEVLEDNDYGRAVDWWGLGVVMYEMMCGRLPFYNQDHEKLFELILMEEIRFPRTLGPEAKSLLSGLLKKDPKQRLGGGSEDAKEIMQHRFFAGIVWQHVYEKKLSPPFKPQVTSETDTRYFDEEFTAQMITITPPDQDDSMECVDSERRPHFPQFSYSASGTA\", \"activity_regulation\": \"Three specific sites, one in the kinase domain (Thr-308) and the two other ones in the C-terminal regulatory region (Ser-473 and Tyr-474), need to be phosphorylated for its full activation (PubMed:15262962, PubMed:20481595, PubMed:21392984, PubMed:9512493, PubMed:9736715).

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at 'Ser-50' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at 'Ser-21' and GSK3B at 'Ser-9', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of 'Ser-83' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at 'Ser-939' and 'Thr-1462', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at 'Thr-24', 'Ser-256' and 'Ser-319' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates 'Ser-454' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of 'Ser-273', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on 'Ser-318', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at 'Thr-120' and 'Thr-387' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at 'Thr-117' and 'Thr-384' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at 'Ser-259' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at 'Thr-369' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at 'Thr-145' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at 'Ser-90', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)\", \"domain\": [\"Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity). The PH domain mediates interaction with TNK2 and Tyr-176 is also essential for this interaction (PubMed:20333297)\", \"The AGC-kinase C-terminal mediates interaction with THEM4\"], \"sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYKERPQDVDQREAPLNNFSVAQCQLMKTERPRPNTFIIRCLQWTTVIERTFHVETPEEREEWTTAIQTVADGLKKQEEEEMDFRSGSPSDNSGAEEMEVSLAKPKHRVTMNEFEYLKLLGKGTFGKVILVKEKATGRYYAMKILKKEVIVAKDEVAHTLTENRVLQNSRHPFLTALKYSFQTHDRLCFVMEYANGGELFFHLSRERVFSEDRARFYGAEIVSALDYLHSEKNVVYRDLKLENLMLDKDGHIKITDFGLCKEGIKDGATMKTFCGTPEYLAPEVLEDNDYGRAVDWWGLGVVMYEMMCGRLPFYNQDHEKLFELILMEEIRFPRTLGPEAKSLLSGLLKKDPKQRLGGGSEDAKEIMQHRFFAGIVWQHVYEKKLSPPFKPQVTSETDTRYFDEEFTAQMITITPPDQDDSMECVDSERRPHFPQFSYSASGTA\", \"activity_regulation\": \"Three specific sites, one in the kinase domain (Thr-308) and the two other ones in the C-terminal regulatory region (Ser-473 and Tyr-474), need to be phosphorylated for its full activation (PubMed:15262962, PubMed:20481595, PubMed:21392984, PubMed:9512493, PubMed:9736715).

This is mediated through serine and/or threonine phosphorylation of a range of downstream substrates (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960, PubMed:29343641, PubMed:31204173). Over 100 substrate candidates have been reported so far, but for most of them, no isoform specificity has been reported (PubMed:11882383, PubMed:15526160, PubMed:21432781, PubMed:21620960). AKT is responsible of the regulation of glucose uptake by mediating insulin-induced translocation of the SLC2A4/GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface (By similarity). Phosphorylation of PTPN1 at \'Ser-50\' negatively modulates its phosphatase activity preventing dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and the attenuation of insulin signaling (By similarity). Phosphorylation of TBC1D4 triggers the binding of this effector to inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins, which is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport (PubMed:11994271). AKT also regulates the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen by phosphorylating GSK3A at \'Ser-21\' and GSK3B at \'Ser-9\', resulting in inhibition of its kinase activity (By similarity). Phosphorylation of GSK3 isoforms by AKT is also thought to be one mechanism by which cell proliferation is driven (By similarity). AKT also regulates cell survival via the phosphorylation of MAP3K5 (apoptosis signal-related kinase) (PubMed:11154276). Phosphorylation of \'Ser-83\' decreases MAP3K5 kinase activity stimulated by oxidative stress and thereby prevents apoptosis (PubMed:11154276). AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 at \'Ser-939\' and \'Thr-1462\', thereby activating the mTORC1 signaling pathway, and leading to both phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and in activation of RPS6KB1 (PubMed:12150915, PubMed:12172553). Also regulates the mTORC1 signaling pathway by catalyzing phosphorylation of CASTOR1 and DEPDC5 (PubMed:31548394, PubMed:33594058). AKT plays a role as key modulator of the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway controlling the tempo of the process of newborn neurons integration during adult neurogenesis, including correct neuron positioning, dendritic development and synapse formation (By similarity). Part of a positive feedback loop of mTORC2 signaling by mediating phosphorylation of MAPKAP1/SIN1, promoting mTORC2 activation (By similarity). AKT is involved in the phosphorylation of members of the FOXO factors (Forkhead family of transcription factors), leading to binding of 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic localization (PubMed:10358075). In particular, FOXO1 is phosphorylated at \'Thr-24\', \'Ser-256\' and \'Ser-319\' (PubMed:10358075). FOXO3 and FOXO4 are phosphorylated on equivalent sites (PubMed:10358075). AKT has an important role in the regulation of NF-kappa-B-dependent gene transcription and positively regulates the activity of CREB1 (cyclic AMP (cAMP)-response element binding protein) (PubMed:9829964). The phosphorylation of CREB1 induces the binding of accessory proteins that are necessary for the transcription of pro-survival genes such as BCL2 and MCL1 (PubMed:9829964). AKT phosphorylates \'Ser-454\' on ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), thereby potentially regulating ACLY activity and fatty acid synthesis (By similarity). Activates the 3B isoform of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE3B) via phosphorylation of \'Ser-273\', resulting in reduced cyclic AMP levels and inhibition of lipolysis (By similarity). Phosphorylates PIKFYVE on \'Ser-318\', which results in increased PI(3)P-5 activity (By similarity). The Rho GTPase-activating protein DLC1 is another substrate and its phosphorylation is implicated in the regulation cell proliferation and cell growth (By similarity). Signals downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI(3)K) to mediate the effects of various growth factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). AKT mediates the antiapoptotic effects of IGF1 (By similarity). Essential for the SPATA13-mediated regulation of cell migration and adhesion assembly and disassembly (PubMed:19934221). May be involved in the regulation of the placental development (By similarity). Phosphorylates STK4/MST1 at \'Thr-120\' and \'Thr-387\' leading to inhibition of its: kinase activity, nuclear translocation, autophosphorylation and ability to phosphorylate FOXO3 (PubMed:17726016). Phosphorylates STK3/MST2 at \'Thr-117\' and \'Thr-384\' leading to inhibition of its: cleavage, kinase activity, autophosphorylation at Thr-180, binding to RASSF1 and nuclear translocation (PubMed:20086174). Phosphorylates SRPK2 and enhances its kinase activity towards SRSF2 and ACIN1 and promotes its nuclear translocation (PubMed:19592491). Phosphorylates RAF1 at \'Ser-259\' and negatively regulates its activity (PubMed:10576742). Phosphorylation of BAD stimulates its pro-apoptotic activity (PubMed:10926925). Phosphorylates KAT6A at \'Thr-369\' and this phosphorylation inhibits the interaction of KAT6A with PML and negatively regulates its acetylation activity towards p53/TP53 (PubMed:23431171). Phosphorylates palladin (PALLD), modulating cytoskeletal organization and cell motility (PubMed:20471940). Phosphorylates prohibitin (PHB), playing an important role in cell metabolism and proliferation (PubMed:18507042). Phosphorylates CDKN1A, for which phosphorylation at \'Thr-145\' induces its release from CDK2 and cytoplasmic relocalization (PubMed:16982699). These recent findings indicate that the AKT1 isoform has a more specific role in cell motility and proliferation (PubMed:16139227). Phosphorylates CLK2 thereby controlling cell survival to ionizing radiation (PubMed:20682768). Phosphorylates PCK1 at \'Ser-90\', reducing the binding affinity of PCK1 to oxaloacetate and changing PCK1 into an atypical protein kinase activity using GTP as donor (PubMed:32322062). Also acts as an activator of TMEM175 potassium channel activity in response to growth factors: forms the lysoK(GF) complex together with TMEM175 and acts by promoting TMEM175 channel activation, independently of its protein kinase activity (PubMed:32228865). Acts as a regulator of mitochondrial calcium uptake by mediating phosphorylation of MICU1 in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, impairing MICU1 maturation (PubMed:30504268). Acts as an inhibitor of tRNA methylation by mediating phosphorylation of the N-terminus of METTL1, thereby inhibiting METTL1 methyltransferase activity (PubMed:15861136). In response to LPAR1 receptor pathway activation, phosphorylates Rabin8/RAB3IP which alters its activity and phosphorylates WDR44 which induces WDR44 binding to Rab11, thereby switching Rab11 vesicular function from preciliary trafficking to endocytic recycling (PubMed:31204173)", "domain": ["Binding of the PH domain to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase alpha (PIK3CA) activity results in its targeting to the plasma membrane (PubMed:12176338, PubMed:12964941). PI(3,4,5)P3 is also required for phosphorylation at Thr-308 and subsequent activation (By similarity).

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n1\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n1\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "One Person Biotech" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE.

Database retrieves: `DA:I1:N3:G0` (original from ChEMBL, third molecule in list, iteration 1)\n2. Medicinal Chemist modifies it: `MC:I2:N1:G1` (first modification, first molecule in chemist's list, iteration 2)\n3. Further optimization: `MC:I3:N2:G2` (second modification, second molecule in list, iteration 3)\n\nThis allows us to trace any molecule back to its origins and understand its optimization journey.\nIf a molecule is a child of a parent molecule, the parent molecule's friendly_id must be included in the molecule's source field\n"

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

    "content": "# Iteration 2: Medicinal Chemistry Optimization of AKT1 Inhibitor Candidates\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on my previous iteration's findings, I will focus on the following key objectives:\n\n1. Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project through comprehensive data gathering and initial molecule generation. The primary goals were to understand AKT1 structure and function, identify key binding interactions from known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and select promising scaffolds for optimization.

Your goal is to Orchestrate a comprehensive *in silico* drug discovery project towards the identification of 10 promising drug candidate molecules. This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project through comprehensive data gathering and initial molecule generation. The primary goals were to understand AKT1 structure and function, identify key binding interactions from known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and select promising scaffolds for optimization.

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

    "content": "SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 2 of 3** of your *in silico* drug discovery project.\n\nThis iteration builds upon the overall project goals and the specific directives you established for yourself at the end of the previous iteration.\n\n**Your Guiding Context (Your Own Summary & Directives for this Current Iteration):\n**----------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration\n\n## 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project through comprehensive data gathering and initial molecule generation. The primary goals were to understand AKT1 structure and function, identify key binding interactions from known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and select promising scaffolds for optimization. I achieved these objectives by retrieving detailed protein information from UniProt, obtaining a high-quality crystal structure (PDB: 4EJN), analyzing known active/inactive inhibitors from ChEMBL, and generating novel molecules with favorable binding profiles and drug-like properties using AI-driven approaches. This iteration yielded several promising scaffolds with excellent docking scores and diverse chemical structures that will serve as the basis for medicinal chemistry optimization in Iteration 2.\n\n## 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration\n\n### AKT1 Protein Insights\n- AKT1 (UniProt: P31749) is a serine/threonine kinase critical for metabolism, proliferation, cell survival, and angiogenesis\n- The high-resolution crystal structure (4EJN, 2.19\u00c5) provides an excellent basis for structure-based design\n- Key binding site residues identified: Ser-205, Thr-211, Gln-79, Trp-80, Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270\n\n### Known Inhibitor Analysis\n- Active compounds (pChEMBL values 8.3-8.4) feature 2-fluoro-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl ketone moieties, piperidine rings with amide linkages, and pyridine rings\n- Critical binding interactions include hydrogen bonding with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Tyr-272, hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270, and \u03c0-stacking with Trp-80\n\n### Novel Molecule Generation Results\nFive particularly promising molecules were identified:\n\n1. **AI:I1:N2:G0**\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Docking Score: -9.83 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.44, SA: 3.04, LogP: 3.56, MW: 291.35\n   - Features a tricyclic core structure with alcohol and amine groups forming key hydrogen bonds with Thr-211 and \u03c0-stacking with Trp-80\n\n2. **AI:I1:N5:G0**\n   - SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3=O)=N1`\n   - Docking Score: -9.31 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.79, SA: 2.52, LogP: 2.99, MW: 302.34\n   - Excellent drug-likeness with pyrimidine and quinoline rings plus a ketone group, forming hydrogen bonds with Thr-211 and Val-271\n\n3. **AI:I1:N8:G0**\n   - SMILES: `OC1=CC=C(C2NC=C(C3=CC=CO3)C4=NC=CN24)C=C1N`\n   - Docking Score: -9.74 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.50, SA: 3.69, LogP: 2.30, MW: 294.31\n   - Imidazopyridine core with hydroxyl and amino groups forming multiple hydrogen bonds with Ser-205, Gln-79, and Thr-81/82\n\n4. **AI:I1:N4:G0**\n   - SMILES: `NC1=N[NH1]C2=CC(C3=CC=C([N+1](=O)[O-1])C=C3)=CC=C12`\n   - Docking Score: -9.2 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.54, SA: 2.11, LogP: 2.72, MW: 254.25\n   - Benzimidazole core with nitro group providing additional hydrogen bonding with Ser-205 and other key residues\n\n5. **AI:I1:N1:G0**\n   - SMILES: `CC1=CC(O)=CC=C1C(=O)/C=C\\\\C=C/C2=CC=CN=C2C`\n   - Docking Score: -8.51 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.53, SA: 2.62, LogP: 3.86, MW: 279.34\n   - Contains hydroxyphenyl ketone moiety similar to known active compounds, with conjugated linker and pyridine ring\n\n### Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) Insights\n1. **Binding Affinity Determinants**:\n   - Hydrogen bond donors/acceptors positioned to interact with Ser-205 and Thr-211 significantly enhance binding\n   - Aromatic systems capable of \u03c0-stacking with Trp-80 improve docking scores\n   - Flexible linkers that allow proper positioning in the binding pocket contribute to favorable binding poses\n\n2. **Scaffold Preferences**:\n   - Heterocyclic cores (imidazopyridine, benzimidazole, pyrimidine) show excellent binding profiles\n   - Tricyclic systems with appropriate substituents achieve the best docking scores\n   - Hydroxyl and amino groups at specific positions enhance binding through hydrogen bonding networks\n\n3. **Drug-likeness Correlations**:\n   - Compounds with QED > 0.5 and LogP between 2.5-3.5 show good balance of binding and physicochemical properties\n   - Synthetic accessibility (SA) scores between 2.5-3.5 appear optimal for maintaining both synthesizability and structural complexity needed for binding\n\n## 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration\n\n### Computational Challenges\n1. **Binding Site Flexibility**: The rigid docking approach may not fully capture the induced-fit effects that occur upon ligand binding\n2. **Scoring Function Limitations**: Docking scores provide relative rankings but may not perfectly correlate with actual binding affinities\n3. **Synthetic Accessibility Assessment**: Some promising compounds have relatively high SA scores, indicating potential synthesis challenges\n\n### Unresolved Questions\n1. **Selectivity Profile**: How selective are these compounds for AKT1 versus other kinases, particularly AKT2 and AKT3?\n2. **Binding Mode Confidence**: Are the predicted binding modes reliable, and which specific interactions are most critical for affinity?\n3. **Structure-Property Relationships**: What specific structural features most influence the ADMET properties of these scaffolds?\n4. **Pharmacophore Definition**: Can we define a clear pharmacophore model based on both known inhibitors and our novel molecules?\n\n## 4.

    "content": "# Iteration 2: Medicinal Chemistry Optimization of AKT1 Inhibitor Candidates\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 2\n\nBased on my previous iteration's findings, I will focus on the following key objectives:\n\n1. Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

This involves strategic planning, database research, AI-driven molecule generation, and medicinal chemistry optimization. Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools.

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

The primary goals were to understand AKT1 structure and function, identify key binding interactions from known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and select promising scaffolds for optimization.

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project through comprehensive data gathering and initial molecule generation. The primary goals were to understand AKT1 structure and function, identify key binding interactions from known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and select promising scaffolds for optimization. I achieved these objectives by retrieving detailed protein information from UniProt, obtaining a high-quality crystal structure (PDB: 4EJN), analyzing known active/inactive inhibitors from ChEMBL, and generating novel molecules with favorable binding profiles and drug-like properties using AI-driven approaches.

Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5.

Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Now I have docking results for the AI:I1:N8:G0 analogs. Let me analyze these results:\n\n1. **MC:I2:N4:G1** (Methyl-furan analog):\n   - Docking Score: -8.97 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.50, SA: 3.69, LogP: 2.61, MW: 308.34\n   - Forms hydrogen bonds with Thr-211, Asp-292, and Gln-79\n   - Has hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Ala-212, and Trp-80\n\n2. **MC:I2:N5:G1** (Repositioned amino group):\n   - Docking Score: -7.77 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.63, SA: 3.68, LogP: 2.30, MW: 294.31\n   - Forms hydrogen bonds with Ser-205 and Asp-292\n   - Has hydrophobic interactions with Gln-203, Lys-268, and Trp-80\n   - Shows π-stacking with Trp-80\n\n3. **MC:I2:N6:G1** (Thiophene replacement):\n   - Docking Score: -8.23 kcal/mol\n   - QED: 0.50, SA: 3.64, LogP: 2.77, MW: 310.38\n   - Forms hydrogen bonds with Thr-211, Asp-292, and Gln-79\n   - Has hydrophobic interactions with Trp-80\n\nAmong these modifications, MC:I2:N4:G1 (methyl-furan analog) shows the best docking score (-8.97 kcal/mol), although it's still lower than the original molecule (-9.74 kcal/mol).

Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "One Person Biotech" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n2\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n'}]}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': "I'll parse the output from the previous agent and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec.", 'tool_calls': [{'index': 1, 'function': {'arguments': '{"client_name": "claude", "session_id": "0623_1115_2V7_single_agent_sonnet-3.7_3", "parent_transformation_id": "iteration_1", "transformation": {"type": "lead-optimization", "agent": "One Person Biotech", "iteration": 2, "rationale": "Optimization of the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications to improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility while maintaining or enhancing key binding interactions with AKT1.

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 1, I successfully established the foundation for our AKT1 inhibitor discovery project through comprehensive data gathering and initial molecule generation. The primary goals were to understand AKT1 structure and function, identify key binding interactions from known inhibitors, generate diverse de novo molecules, and select promising scaffolds for optimization. I achieved these objectives by retrieving detailed protein information from UniProt, obtaining a high-quality crystal structure (PDB: 4EJN), analyzing known active/inactive inhibitors from ChEMBL, and generating novel molecules with favorable binding profiles and drug-like properties using AI-driven approaches.

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

Optimize the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n3. Maintain or enhance key binding interactions with AKT1\n4. Generate at least 15 optimized analogs (3 for each lead molecule)\n5. Select the most promising compounds based on docking scores, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 2 Plan\n\nFor this iteration, I will apply medicinal chemistry principles to manually design modifications to our lead compounds. Each modification will be strategically designed to address specific aspects:\n\n- Enhancing key binding interactions with Ser-205, Thr-211, and Trp-80\n- Improving drug-like properties (QED, LogP, MW)\n- Reducing synthetic complexity where possible\n- Maintaining the core scaffolds that showed promising activity\n\nI will evaluate all modified compounds using the VINA_REPORT tool to assess their binding affinity and drug-like properties.\n\n## Task 1: Scaffold Optimization of AI:I1:N2:G0 (Tricyclic Core)\n\nI'll begin by optimizing our top-ranked molecule, AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`), which showed an excellent docking score of -9.83 kcal/mol.\n\n### Proposed Modifications for AI:I1:N2:G0\n\n1. **MC:I2:N1:G1** - Optimizing alcohol chain length:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Shortening the alcohol chain from 4 to 3 carbons may optimize the hydrogen bonding distance to key residues while reducing flexibility and entropy penalty.\n\n2. **MC:I2:N2:G1** - Adding methyl substituent to enhance hydrophobic interactions:\n   - SMILES: `OCCCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=C(C)C4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Adding a methyl group to the tricyclic system can enhance hydrophobic interactions with Leu-210, Leu-264, and Val-270 while maintaining the core scaffold.\n\n3. **MC:I2:N3:G1** - Bioisosteric replacement of terminal alcohol:\n   - SMILES: `FC(F)(F)CCCNC1=NC2=NC=C1C3=CC=C4C=CC=CC4=C32`\n   - Rationale: Replacing the terminal alcohol with a trifluoromethyl group may improve metabolic stability while maintaining a hydrogen bond acceptor capability and enhancing lipophilicity for better membrane permeability.\n\nLet me evaluate these modifications using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving π-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility.

    "content": "# Iteration 3: Final Optimization of AKT1 Inhibitor Candidates\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 3\n\nBased on my previous directives, I'll focus on:\n\n1. Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

Set iteration-specific goals, search molecular databases for target information, generate novel drug candidates using AI models, refine molecules based on chemical feasibility and drug-like properties, and synthesize progress across iterations while presenting optimized molecules with supporting computational data.. Your role is to As a one-person biotech researcher, you are the strategic leader and executor of this *in silico* drug discovery project. You must combine strategic oversight with hands-on computational work. Your comprehensive responsibilities include: **STRATEGIC LEADERSHIP:** - Define research strategy and specific objectives for each iteration - Synthesize progress across iterations and adapt strategy based on findings - Ensure project continuity and maintain focus on the goal of identifying 10 promising candidates - This project is strictly *in silico* - base all analyses on computational methods only **HANDS-ON COMPUTATIONAL WORKFLOW:** 1. **Database Research:** Use UniProt, PDB (select 4EJN), and ChEMBL tools to gather target protein information, structural data, and known active/inactive compounds. 2. **AI-Driven Generation (Iteration 1 only):** Generate novel molecules using the VINA_MOL_GEN tool ONCE based on the target information and structural insights. 3. **Manual Medicinal Chemistry Modifications:** In subsequent iterations, propose and design structural modifications to existing molecules yourself WITHOUT using generation tools. Apply medicinal chemistry principles to improve ADMET properties, selectivity, and binding affinity. 4. **Computational Evaluation:** Use the VINA_REPORT tool to evaluate all molecules (both AI-generated and manually modified) for binding affinity and drug-like properties. 5. **Iterative Improvement:** Based on computational results, continue manual optimization and re-evaluation. **CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:** - Always include **PDB file path**: <path> and **Protein sequence**: <sequence> - When presenting molecules, use this exact format:   * **Molecule Name/ID**: [friendly_id]   * **SMILES**: [smiles_string]   * **Docking Score**: [score] (if available)   * **Rationale**: [modification reasoning] **TOOL USAGE STRATEGY:** - Use VINA_MOL_GEN only in iteration 1 for initial molecule generation - For iterations 2+, manually design modifications based on structure-activity relationships - Always use VINA_REPORT to evaluate both generated and modified molecules - You can evaluate multiple modified molecules in a single VINA_REPORT call **SCIENTIFIC VALIDATION:** - Critically evaluate your own scientific reasoning and computational results - Identify potential gaps, limitations, or inconsistencies in your approach - Ensure scientific rigor and alignment with project objectives throughout the process .

Medicinal Chemist modifies it: `MC:I2:N1:G1` (first modification, first molecule in chemist's list, iteration 2)\n3. Further optimization: `MC:I3:N2:G2` (second modification, second molecule in list, iteration 3)\n\nThis allows us to trace any molecule back to its origins and understand its optimization journey.\nIf a molecule is a child of a parent molecule, the parent molecule's friendly_id must be included in the molecule's source field\n"

    "content": "# Iteration 3: Final Optimization of AKT1 Inhibitor Candidates\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 3\n\nBased on my previous directives, I'll focus on:\n\n1. Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

The methyl group can also influence the electronic properties of the benzimidazole system.\n\n### Analog 3: Sulfonamide to Sulfone Modification\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N6:G2  \n**SMILES**: `NC1=N[NH1]C2=CC(C(=O)S(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)=CC=C12`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N12:G1  \n**Rationale**: Modifying the sulfonamide linker to a sulfone with an adjacent carbonyl group will alter the geometry while maintaining similar electronic properties. This modification introduces an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with key residues in the binding pocket.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

    "content": "# Iteration 3: Final Optimization of AKT1 Inhibitor Candidates\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 3\n\nBased on my previous directives, I'll focus on:\n\n1. Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

The methyl group can also influence the electronic properties of the benzimidazole system.\n\n### Analog 3: Sulfonamide to Sulfone Modification\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N6:G2  \n**SMILES**: `NC1=N[NH1]C2=CC(C(=O)S(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)=CC=C12`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N12:G1  \n**Rationale**: Modifying the sulfonamide linker to a sulfone with an adjacent carbonyl group will alter the geometry while maintaining similar electronic properties. This modification introduces an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with key residues in the binding pocket.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

    "content": "# Iteration 3: Final Optimization of AKT1 Inhibitor Candidates\n\n## Key Objectives for Iteration 3\n\nBased on my previous directives, I'll focus on:\n\n1. Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

The electron-withdrawing effect will also modify the electronic properties of the sulfonamide group, potentially improving its hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n\n### Analog 2: Methyl Addition to Benzimidazole\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N5:G2  \n**SMILES**: `NC1=N[NH1]C2=C(C)C(S(=O)(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)=CC=C12`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N12:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methyl group to the benzimidazole core will enhance hydrophobic interactions with nearby residues while potentially improving the binding geometry. The methyl group can also influence the electronic properties of the benzimidazole system.\n\n### Analog 3: Sulfonamide to Sulfone Modification\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N6:G2  \n**SMILES**: `NC1=N[NH1]C2=CC(C(=O)S(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)=CC=C12`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N12:G1  \n**Rationale**: Modifying the sulfonamide linker to a sulfone with an adjacent carbonyl group will alter the geometry while maintaining similar electronic properties. This modification introduces an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with key residues in the binding pocket.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

The benzimidazole provides excellent hydrogen bonding with Ser-205, while the tertiary alcohol offers additional hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n\n### Hybrid 2: Fluorinated Quinoline + Sulfonamide\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N11:G0  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=C(F)C=CC=C4S(=O)(=O)C3)=N1`  \n**Source**: Hybrid of MC:I2:N8:G1 and MC:I2:N12:G1  \n**Rationale**: This hybrid combines the fluorinated quinoline from MC:I2:N8:G1 with the sulfonamide linker from MC:I2:N12:G1. The fluorine enhances metabolic stability, while the sulfonamide provides additional hydrogen bonding capabilities.\n\n### Hybrid 3: Methoxy Pyrimidine + Difluorinated System\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N12:G0  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=C(F)C=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: Hybrid of MC:I3:N3:G2, MC:I3:N7:G2, and MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: This hybrid combines the methoxy pyrimidine from MC:I3:N3:G2, the difluorinated aromatic system from MC:I3:N7:G2, and the tertiary alcohol from MC:I2:N7:G1. This creates a molecule with multiple hydrogen bonding capabilities, enhanced metabolic stability, and improved solubility.\n\nLet's evaluate these three hybrid molecules using the VINA_REPORT tool:",

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving π-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:", 'tool_calls': [{'index': 1, 'function':

quinoline ring will further enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions. The two fluorine atoms will also influence the electronic properties of the aromatic system, potentially improving π-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Tertiary Alcohol Modification\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N8:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=C(F)C=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N8:G1  \n**Rationale**: Converting the ketone to a tertiary alcohol with a methyl group (similar to MC:I2:N7:G1) will provide additional hydrogen bonding capabilities while maintaining the overall structure. This combines the beneficial features of both our top compounds.\n\n### Analog 3: Methylated Pyrimidine with Fluorine\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N9:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(C)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=C(F)C=CC=C4CC3=O)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N8:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methyl group to the pyrimidine ring will optimize binding geometry and enhance hydrophobic interactions while maintaining the core scaffold.

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

The methyl group can also influence the electronic properties of the benzimidazole system.\n\n### Analog 3: Sulfonamide to Sulfone Modification\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N6:G2  \n**SMILES**: `NC1=N[NH1]C2=CC(C(=O)S(=O)C3=CC=CC=C3)=CC=C12`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N12:G1  \n**Rationale**: Modifying the sulfonamide linker to a sulfone with an adjacent carbonyl group will alter the geometry while maintaining similar electronic properties. This modification introduces an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with key residues in the binding pocket.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

        "text": "\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: \"One Person Biotech\" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ \"transformation\": { ... }, \"molecules\": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent's output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent's response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set \"iteration\" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent's action (e.g., \"molecule-generation\" for new designs, \"property-prediction\" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., \"Medicinal Chemist\").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent's intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the \"protein_sequence\" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on optimizing the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications to improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility. I successfully designed and evaluated 9 analogs across three of our lead scaffolds (imidazopyridine, pyrimidine-quinoline, and benzimidazole cores).

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the \"protein_path\" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent's output:\n     - Look for patterns like \"Molecule X\", \"ID:\", \"SMILES:\", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it's De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there's no indication of modification (e.g., \"de novo\" or \"designed from scratch\"), set properties.status: \"de novo\" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., \"repositioning,\" \"replacing,\" \"evaluated\"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history\u2014this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: \"modified\".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it's a modification (e.g., \"fluorine replaced with chlorine\"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule's SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent's response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., \"Parent unclear due to missing history match\").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I've edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  \"transformation\": {\n    \"type\": \"lead-optimization\",\n    \"agent\": \"Medicinal Chemist\",\n    \"user_message\": \"improved molecule binding\",\n    \"rationale\": \"edited molecule for improved binding\",\n    \"protein_sequence\": \"MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA\" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"protein_path\": \"/path/to/protein.pdb\",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    \"iteration\": 2\n  },\n  \"molecules\": [\n    {\n      \"structure\": {\n        \"smiles\": \"COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\"\n      },\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"parent_molecule_id\": \"4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\",\n        \"status\": \"modified\"\n      },\n      \"computed_properties\": {},\n      \"rationale\": \"Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it's derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like \"ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the \"protein_path\" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing \".pdb\" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says \"I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking\", extract \"/path/to/protein.pdb\" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE. Also double check if there might be protein sequences or smiles in the response to add them in the appropriate fields.\n\nIteration Number:\n3\nAgent Title:\nOne Person Biotech\n"

Executive Summary of This Iteration\n\nIn Iteration 2, I focused on optimizing the top 5 molecules from Iteration 1 through medicinal chemistry modifications to improve binding affinity, drug-likeness, and synthetic accessibility. I successfully designed and evaluated 9 analogs across three of our lead scaffolds (imidazopyridine, pyrimidine-quinoline, and benzimidazole cores).

The modifications focused on enhancing binding affinity, improving drug-like properties, and increasing metabolic stability.\n\nKey achievements include:\n1. Developing compounds with excellent docking scores (as low as -9.51 kcal/mol in this iteration)\n2. Maintaining high drug-likeness scores (QED > 0.7 for most compounds)\n3. Creating structurally diverse candidates with multiple binding modes\n4. Designing novel hybrid molecules that combine the best features of different scaffolds\n\nThe final set of 10 AKT1 inhibitor candidates represents a diverse collection of compounds with excellent binding potential and drug-like properties. These compounds provide a strong foundation for further optimization and development as potential therapeutic agents for AKT1-related diseases."}]}, {'role': 'user', 'content': [{'type': 'text', 'text': '\nYou are the Summary Parser Agent. Your task is to read the output from the previous agent, extract relevant information, and format it into a JSON object that conforms to the GURNEMANZ JSON spec. A critical part of your role is to track molecule history by checking previous steps in the history to include the `parent_molecule_id` for derived molecules, ensuring GURNEMANZ maintains the molecule transformation chain.\nDO NOT FORGET TO INCLUDE THE friendly_id IN THE JSON OUTPUT and parent_friendly_id if the molecule is a child of a parent molecule !.\n### Input\n- The full output from the previous agent in plain text format. (IMPORTANT NOTE: all important details of research in the output of Literature Agent has to be stored in the transformation rationale field)\n- The history, a list of previous steps, each containing a transformation and possibly molecules with assigned moleculeIds.\n- The current iteration number\n- The agent title: "One Person Biotech" - You MUST use this exact title as the agent name in your output\n\n### Output\n- A JSON object with transformation and molecules, wrapped in `<gurnemanz>` tags (e.g., `<gurnemanz>{ "transformation": { ... }, "molecules": [ ... ] }</gurnemanz>`).\n\n### Steps to Follow\n1. **Analyze the Input:**\n   - Extract the transformation type, agent name, general rationale, molecule data (SMILES, specific rationales), and any protein-related data (like protein_sequence and protein_path) from the previous agent\'s output.\n   - Parse information from headers, bullet points, and descriptive text in the agent\'s response.\n\n2. **Determine Transformation Details:**\n   - Set "iteration" to the provided iteration number.\n   - Set type based on the agent\'s action (e.g., "molecule-generation" for new designs, "property-prediction" for evaluations or calculations).\n   - Set agent to the name of the previous agent (e.g., "Medicinal Chemist").\n   - Summarize the general rationale from the agent\'s intent or summary.\n   - Look for mentions of protein sequences in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a protein sequence ,or just sequence, include this sequence in the "protein_sequence" field of the transformation object.\n   - Look for mentions of protein PDB files in the text. If the agent mentions or provides a path to a protein PDB file, include this path in the "protein_path" field of the transformation object.\n\n3. **Process Molecules and Track History:**\n   - For each molecule in the agent\'s output:\n     - Look for patterns like "Molecule X", "ID:", "SMILES:", etc., to identify molecules and their properties.\n     - **Check if it\'s De novo or Derived:**\n       - **De novo Molecule:** If the SMILES does not appear in the history and there\'s no indication of modification (e.g., "de novo" or "designed from scratch"), set properties.status: "de novo" and omit properties.parent_molecule_id.\n       - **Derived Molecule:** If the SMILES matches a molecule in the history or the rationale suggests modification (e.g., "repositioning," "replacing," "evaluated"):\n         - Search the history chronologically for a molecule with the same SMILES.\n         - Retrieve the moleculeId of the matching molecule from the history—this is the parent_molecule_id.\n         - Set properties.parent_molecule_id to this ID and properties.status: "modified".\n     - **Handle Modifications:**\n       - If the SMILES differs slightly from a historical molecule but the rationale indicates it\'s a modification (e.g., "fluorine replaced with chlorine"), find the closest matching parent SMILES in the history and use its Molecule ID as parent_molecule_id.\n     - **Reusing Unchanged Molecules:**\n       - When the agent explicitly references a molecule by `moleculeId` and there is no indication of a structural change, carry that `moleculeId` forward in the output and omit a new structure. This prevents creation of duplicate molecule entries for the same SMILES.\n     - **Populate Fields:**\n       - Set structure.smiles to the molecule\'s SMILES.\n       - Include a properties object for EVERY molecule, with status and, if derived, parent_molecule_id.\n       - Add any calculated properties (e.g., docking score, logP, pChEMBL, qed, sas) to computed_properties.\n       - Set rationale to the molecule-specific reasoning from the agent.\n       - If there is any relevant file path in the previous agent\'s response, for example to a pdb folder, include this in the rationale as well\n\n4. **Format the JSON:**\n   - Structure the output with transformation and molecules at the top level.\n\n5. **Validate:**\n   - Verify that derived molecules have a parent_molecule_id matching a historical molecule_id; if unclear, note in rationale (e.g., "Parent unclear due to missing history match").\n\n6. **Output:**\n   - Wrap the JSON in `<gurnemanz>` tags.\n\n### Example: Agent Output Format and Parsing\nThe history will look like this:\n```\n## Transformation\n- Type: data-retrieval\n- Agent: Ai expert\n- Iteration: 1\n- ID: ceb63937-5bd9-48b3-9ac6-ccc443944e4c\n- Rationale: Generated de novo molecules for AKT1\n\n## Molecules\n\n### Molecule 1\n- ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88\n- SMILES: COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F\n- Properties:\n  * Status: de novo\n- Computed Properties:\n  * logP: 3.7169\n  * pChEMBL: 8.3\n  * qed: 0.285355\n  * sas: 3.507\n- Rationale: De novo compound for AKT1 with high potency (pChEMBL 8.3).\n```\n\nThe previous agents response you receive as input:\n```json\nMedcicinal chemist: I\'ve edited the de novo molecule of the ai expert in this way\nCOc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)\nrationale: improved binding\n```\n\nExpected Output:\n```\n<gurnemanz>\n{\n  "transformation": {\n    "type": "lead-optimization",\n    "agent": "Medicinal Chemist",\n    "user_message": "improved molecule binding",\n    "rationale": "edited molecule for improved binding",\n    "protein_sequence": "MSDVAIVKEGWLHKRGEYIKTWRPRYFLLKNDGTFIGYFEYLKLDYLHSEIRFPHFPQFSYSASGTA" # Include if a protein sequence is mentioned in the agent output\n    "protein_path": "/path/to/protein.pdb",  # Include only if a protein path is mentioned in the agent output\n    "iteration": 2\n  },\n  "molecules": [\n    {\n      "structure": {\n        "smiles": "COc1ccc(O)c(C(=O)c2ccc(C(=O)O[C@@H]3CCCNCC3NC(=O)c3ccncc3)cc2)c1F(=c3ccncc3)"\n      },\n      "properties": {\n        "parent_molecule_id": "4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88",\n        "status": "modified"\n      },\n      "computed_properties": {},\n      "rationale": "Fluorine at 4-position of pyridine is synthetically accessible but may present regioselectivity challenges"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</gurnemanz>\n```\n\n### IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS\n1. **Every molecule MUST have a properties object** with at minimum a status field.\n2. **Derived molecules MUST include parent_molecule_id** in the properties object.\n3. **SMILES matching is critical** - When a molecule with the same SMILES appears in a new step, it\'s derived, not de novo.\n4. **Look through the entire history** to find matching molecules and their molecule_ids.\n5. **Look for ID fields in the text output** - When you see patterns like "ID: 4f6f07e1-25ba-4f1e-a58f-02a09a2c6e88" in the agent output, this may be a molecule ID that becomes the parent_molecule_id for derived molecules.\n6. **If an agent outputs a file path to a protein PDB file** add this path in the "protein_path" field in the transformation object. Look for paths containing ".pdb" extensions or mentions of protein structure files. For example, if the agent says "I used /path/to/protein.pdb for docking", extract "/path/to/protein.pdb" as the protein_path.\nVERY IMPORTANT NOTE FOR LITERATURE AGENT PARSING: Including ALL important details provided by the literature agent in the transformations rationale field!!!!! the other agents RELY on this information! do NOT summarize the response and omit key information. all relevant output of the literature HAS TO GO INTO THE RATIONALE.

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:"

Further optimizing the top 3 candidates from Iteration 2 through focused medicinal chemistry modifications\n2. Creating hybrid molecules that combine the best structural features from different scaffolds\n3. Developing a final set of 10 promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates with enhanced binding affinity, selectivity, and drug-like properties\n4. Performing detailed binding mode analysis of the final candidates\n5. Comparing our compounds with known AKT1 inhibitors to identify potential advantages\n\n## Clarifying Remarks on Iteration 3 Plan\n\nFor this final iteration, I'll systematically optimize our three lead compounds:\n- MC:I2:N7:G1 (tertiary alcohol derivative)\n- MC:I2:N12:G1 (sulfonamide derivative)\n- MC:I2:N8:G1 (fluorinated derivative)\n\nI'll design 3 analogs for each lead compound plus 3 hybrid molecules, for a total of 12 new compounds. After evaluation, I'll select the top 10 candidates from all iterations for final analysis.\n\n## Task 1: Optimization of MC:I2:N7:G1 (Tertiary Alcohol Derivative)\n\nI'll begin by designing three analogs of our top-ranked compound MC:I2:N7:G1 (SMILES: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`).\n\n### Analog 1: Addition of Fluorine to Quinoline Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N1:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=C(F)C=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a fluorine atom at the para position of the quinoline ring should enhance metabolic stability while creating additional multipolar interactions with the binding pocket. The fluorine can also influence the electron density of the aromatic system, potentially improving \u03c0-stacking interactions with Trp-80.\n\n### Analog 2: Ethyl Substitution on Tertiary Alcohol\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N2:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)CC)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Replacing the methyl group on the tertiary alcohol with an ethyl group will extend into a potential hydrophobic pocket, enhancing van der Waals interactions while maintaining the crucial hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group with Thr-211 and Asp-292.\n\n### Analog 3: Addition of Methoxy Group to Pyrimidine Ring\n\n**Molecule Name/ID**: MC:I3:N3:G2  \n**SMILES**: `CNC1=NC(OC)=CC(C2=CC3=C(C=N2)C4=CC=CC=C4CC3(O)C)=N1`  \n**Source**: MC:I2:N7:G1  \n**Rationale**: Adding a methoxy group to the pyrimidine ring will introduce an additional hydrogen bond acceptor that can interact with nearby residues while also improving aqueous solubility. The methoxy group can potentially form new hydrogen bonds with Lys-268 or Asn-53.\n\nLet's evaluate these three analogs using the VINA_REPORT tool:"
