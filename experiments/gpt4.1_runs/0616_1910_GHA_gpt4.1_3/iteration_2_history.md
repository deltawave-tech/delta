# Iteration 2 History

## User

SYSTEM: Welcome to **Iteration 2 of 3** of our *in silico* drug discovery project:

Here is the context of the project objective and scope of this iteration:

----------------------------------------------------------------------


You are now in the 'Lead Optimization' phase for designing AKT1 inhibitors.

==============================================================
LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. The brainstorming phase ended with a clear plan (referred
   to here as 'the strategy'), which guides how the Medicinal
   Chemist should modify or optimize molecules. We have:

   - 5 active and 5 inactive compounds (all with docking + PLIP).
   - de novo molecules from the AI Expert, each with
     docking + PLIP data.

2. Participants:
   - Medicinal Chemist: proposes new analogs per iteration and finalize the 10 molecules.
   - Ranking Agent: Rank the molecules based on the docking scores and the other metrics.
   - Scientific Critic: checks for logical or scientific
     inconsistencies, advises caution if modifications seem
     unfeasible or contradictory.

3. Automatic Workflow:
   - Each time the Medicinal Chemist proposes a set of analogs,
     docking should run by the its tools, then PLIP highlights
     protein-ligand interactions.
   - The Ranking Agent and Critic see these results
     and give feedback.

==============================================================
RULES & FLOW
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Each iteration begins with the Medicinal Chemist proposing
  3 structural modifications based on the prior feedback,
  docking, and PLIP results.
- Docking + PLIP run automatically for each analog.
- The Scientific Critic can highlight any chemical or
  logical red flags.
- We track progress iteration by iteration, aiming to see
  if the docking surpasses the 10% improvement threshold.
- Finally lets have 10 optimized molecules.
- Most important thing is for all molecules to have docking scores and other metrics.
This way ranking agent can rank them and we can see the progress.
==============================================================
END OF SYSTEM PROMPT

**Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration (Lead Optimization Phase)**

---

### 1. Executive Summary of This Iteration

**Main Goals:**  
- To establish a robust *in silico* foundation for AKT1 inhibitor discovery by integrating reference data, generating novel chemical matter, and performing initial medicinal chemistry optimization and ranking.

**Progress:**  
- The team successfully mined and curated a diverse set of AKT1 actives/inactives, generated novel de novo molecules, performed rational modifications, and prioritized candidates using multi-parameter *in silico* metrics.  
- A clear SAR and molecular genealogy were established, setting the stage for focused lead optimization.

---

### 2. Key *In Silico* Findings & Discoveries from This Iteration

- **Novel Scaffolds & Modifications:**  
  - AI Expert introduced new chemotypes, notably sulfonamide-thiosemicarbazone hybrids (e.g., AI:I1:N1:G0) and substituted aromatic/heterocyclic systems.
  - Medicinal Chemist improved these scaffolds with polarity-modulating capping groups (e.g., MC:I1:N2:G1, MC:I1:N3:G1) and metabolic stability-enhancing substitutions (e.g., MC:I1:N4:G1, MC:I1:N5:G1).

- **Top Molecular Candidates (by Ranking Agent):**  
  1. **MC:I1:N3:G1** (SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)C=CC1=C(NN=CC=C(N2CCC(C(F)(F)F)CC2)C=C1)SC(=O)C)  
     - Docking: -10.25, QED: 0.68, SA: 3.68, logP: 3.21  
  2. **MC:I1:N2:G1** (SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)C=CC1=C(NN=CC=C(N2CCC(C(F)(F)F)CC2)C=C1)SC(=O)N)  
     - Docking: -10.19, QED: 0.60, SA: 3.74, logP: 2.74  
  3. **AI:I1:N1:G0** (SMILES: NS(=O)(=O)C=CC1=C(NN=CC=C(N2CCC(C(F)(F)F)CC2)C=C1)SC)  
     - Docking: -9.75, QED: 0.73, SA: 3.58, logP: 3.29  
  4. **MC:I1:N5:G1** (SMILES: CC(C)(C)C1=CC=C(NC(=O)NC=C2C=CN=C(NC3=CC=CC(C(F)(F)F)=C3)C2=C)C=C1OCC)  
     - Docking: -9.67, QED: 0.42, SA: 3.03, logP: 5.51  
  5. **MC:I1:N4:G1** (SMILES: CC(C)(C)C1=CC=C(NC(=O)NC=C2C=CN=C(NC3=CC=CC(C(F)(F)F)=C3)C2=C)C=C1OCF)  
     - Docking: -9.44, QED: 0.39, SA: 3.19, logP: 5.42  

- **SAR & Insights:**  
  - Sulfonamide-thiosemicarbazone hybrids with polar capping groups (amide, methyl ketone) consistently yielded strong docking and QED scores.
  - Substitutions on aromatic rings (fluoro, methoxy, ethoxy) modulated logP and QED, with some trade-offs in synthetic accessibility.
  - High SA scores (>3.5) in top candidates highlight a need to balance potency with synthetic tractability.

---

### 3. *In Silico* Challenges & Unresolved Questions from This Iteration

- **Synthetic Accessibility:**  
  - Several top candidates have borderline or high SA scores, raising concerns about practical tractability.
- **Chemical Diversity:**  
  - Top-ranked molecules are structurally related; scaffold diversity should be monitored to avoid redundancy in the final candidate pool.
- **Inactive Reference Utilization:**  
  - Inactive molecules from the database were not leveraged for selectivity or negative design; this remains an opportunity for further *in silico* selectivity profiling.
- **Docking Score Interpretation:**  
  - Differences in docking scores among top candidates are modest; additional *in silico* metrics (e.g., MM-GBSA, water-mediated interactions) could be considered if available.
- **Unresolved Questions:**  
  - Which modifications can further improve synthetic accessibility without sacrificing potency?
  - Can selectivity against AKT1 versus related kinases be predicted or approximated using available *in silico* tools?

---

### 4. Strategic Outlook & Actionable *In Silico* Directives for Next Iteration

#### a. Overarching Goal for Next Iteration

**Primary Objective:**  
To optimize and diversify the top-ranked AKT1 inhibitor candidates from Iteration 1, focusing on improving synthetic accessibility, maintaining or enhancing predicted potency (docking), and ensuring chemical diversity. The aim is to advance a robust, non-redundant set of leads toward final candidate selection.

#### b. Specific Tasks & Focus Areas for Each Available Agent

---

**Principal Researcher (Yourself):**
- Oversee and coordinate the lead optimization process.
- Ensure that modifications proposed by the Medicinal Chemist address both potency and synthetic accessibility.
- Monitor chemical diversity and SAR evolution across the candidate pool.
- Synthesize findings and provide strategic guidance at the end of the iteration.

---

**Medicinal Chemist:**
- Focus on the top 5 ranked molecules from Iteration 1 (MC:I1:N3:G1, MC:I1:N2:G1, AI:I1:N1:G0, MC:I1:N5:G1, MC:I1:N4:G1).
- Propose and execute modifications aimed at:
  - Reducing SA scores (target <3.5 where possible) while retaining or improving docking and QED.
  - Introducing structural diversity (e.g., ring size variation, bioisosteric replacements, alternative capping groups).
  - Exploring modifications that may enhance selectivity for AKT1 (e.g., targeting unique binding site features).
- Use the VINA_REPORT tool for all new/modified molecules and document all parent-child relationships.
- Provide clear rationales for each modification, referencing SAR and *in silico* metrics.

---

**Ranking Agent:**
- Rank all newly generated and modified molecules using the following criteria:
  - Docking score (primary), QED, SA score, logP (2–5.5 preferred), and chemical diversity.
  - Prioritize molecules with improved synthetic accessibility and non-redundant scaffolds.
  - If possible, flag molecules with predicted selectivity advantages or unique interaction profiles.
- Consider introducing a diversity metric (e.g., Tanimoto similarity) to help avoid redundancy in the top 10.

---

**Scientific Critic:**
- Critically evaluate the Medicinal Chemist’s modifications for:
  - Feasibility and synthetic tractability (especially for molecules with borderline SA scores).
  - The robustness and appropriateness of the Ranking Agent’s evaluation criteria, especially regarding chemical diversity and selectivity.
  - The scientific rationale behind modifications—ensure they are grounded in SAR and *in silico* evidence.
- Identify any logical inconsistencies, missed opportunities, or areas where the workflow could be improved.

---

#### c. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Next Iteration

- At least 3–5 new or modified molecules with SA score <3.5 and docking score ≤ -9.0.
- Demonstrated increase in scaffold diversity among top-ranked candidates.
- Clear, rational SAR progression and documentation of all modifications.
- No more than 2 top-10 candidates with highly similar scaffolds (Tanimoto similarity >0.85).

---

**All agents should remain strictly within the *in silico* domain. No new database mining or AI de novo generation is permitted in this iteration.**
