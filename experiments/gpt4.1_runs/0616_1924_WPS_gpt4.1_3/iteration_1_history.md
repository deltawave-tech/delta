[{'type': 'text', 'text': "\nYou are participating in a collaborative multi-agent meeting focused on optimizing de novo molecules for a specific target. \nThis project will unfold over **three iterations**. Your task is to iteratively refine candidate molecules using each agent’s specialized expertise. \nThe final goal is to deliver 10 optimized molecules with clearly documented modifications and supporting *in silico* metrics. For the target given by the user.\n\n**Inter-Iteration Process:**\n* At the end of each iterations (expect the last iteration: 3), the Principal Researcher will provide a 'Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration'.\n* This summary, along with all molecules generated, will be the primary context carried forward to the next iteration.\n* **Agent Availability Changes:**\n    * **Iteration 1 (Current):** Database Agent, AI Expert, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent, Scientific Critic, Principal Researcher.\n    * **Iteration 2 (LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT):** Principal Researcher, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent, Scientific Critic. (Database Agent & AI Expert will NOT be present).\n    * **Iteration 3 (FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT):** Principal Researcher, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent. (Database Agent, AI Expert, & Scientific Critic will NOT be present).\n\n==============================================================\nMEETING CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  **Overall Objective:**\n    * Optimize de novo molecules for a specific target by incorporating cross-disciplinary *in silico* insights.\n    * Integrate modifications with clear rationales and *in silico* metrics (e.g., docking scores, QED, SA score, molecular weight).\n    * Present 10 final optimized molecules with their *in silico* data at the end of Iteration 3.\n\n2.  **Agents & Their Roles (General - specific iteration presence noted above):**\n    * **Database Agent:** Retrieves and aggregates data from chemical and biological databases (e.g., UniProt, PDB, ChEMBL). Provide reference data on active/inactive molecules along with their metrics.\n    * **AI Expert:** Uses deep learning and generative models for *de novo* molecule design.\n    * **Medicinal Chemist:** Modifies molecules to improve *in silico* properties (activity, drug-likeness) and evaluates them using its tools (e.g., VINA_REPORT).\n    * **Ranking Agent:** Ranks molecules based on multi-parameter *in silico* evaluation.\n    * **Scientific Critic:** Reviews discussion for logical consistency, completeness, and scientific rigor within the *in silico* framework.\n    * **Principal Researcher:** Leads the team, sets goals, synthesizes information, and provides iterative summaries and directives.\n\n3.  **Decision Pathways (Guidance for PR within iterations):**\n    * The Principal Researcher will guide discussions and help the team converge on promising strategies based on agent inputs.\n\n==============================================================\nRULES & FLOW (for the current iteration)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n-   **Kick-off:** The Principal Researcher will start by stating the overall project goal (already known) and the specific objectives for **this current iteration (Iteration 1)**.\n-   **Data Sharing (Iteration 1):** The Database Agent will typically be called upon early to provide reference data (protein sequence, protein PDB file, active/inactive molecules, etc.)\n-   **Discussion:** Agents will propose modifications, debate impacts using *in silico* metrics, and refine ideas.\n-   **Closure of Iteration:** The Principal Researcher will conclude the iteration by providing their summary and directives for the next.\n-   **Output Format for Molecules (when presented by Database, AI, MedChem):**\n    (Your existing structured format including SMILES, friendly_id, metrics, etc., should be detailed here if it's not part of a separate `molecule_format_guide` in the agent's system prompt)\n    * Ensure all molecules have relevant *in silico* metrics (docking scores, QED, SA score, etc.) for ranking and progress tracking.\n\n==============================================================\nEND of CONTEXT\n  "}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '<molecules>\n{\n    "current_iteration": 1,\n    "critic_review": [\n        {\n            "category": "General Methodology",\n            "feedback": "The team has demonstrated a systematic approach: starting with reference data (Database Agent), generating de novo candidates (AI Expert), performing rational modifications (Medicinal Chemist), and ranking based on multi-parameter *in silico* metrics (Ranking Agent). The use of the friendly_id system ensures traceability and SAR clarity. However, there are several areas where scientific rigor and clarity can be improved."\n        },\n        {\n            "category": "Reference Data & Diversity",\n            "feedback": "The Database Agent provided a solid set of actives/inactives with diverse scaffolds and detailed metrics. However, the rationale for selecting specific reference molecules for SAR benchmarking was not always explicit. For future iterations, please clarify why certain scaffolds or activity profiles are prioritized for optimization."\n        },\n        {\n            "category": "AI Expert Molecule Design",\n            "feedback": "The AI Expert generated four de novo molecules, each with reasonable QED and docking scores. However, for molecule AI:I1:N1:G0 (SMILES: COC1=CC=C(/C=C/C2=NNC3=CC(Cl)=CC=C23)C=C1C), the rationale emphasizes π-π stacking and H-bonding, but the actual PLIP interactions reported are mostly hydrophobic, with only one H-bond. This discrepancy should be addressed—are the design hypotheses being validated by the docking/interactions? For molecule AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: N=1CC=C2NC(NCC3=CC=CC=C3)=CN=C2C=1C4=CC=CC5=CC=CN=C45), the docking score is strong (-9.72), but the QED (0.74) and SA (3.16) are only moderate. Consider whether further modifications could improve synthetic accessibility without sacrificing activity."\n        },\n        {\n            "category": "Medicinal Chemistry Modifications",\n            "feedback": "The Medicinal Chemist made logical modifications, such as introducing amide groups for MC:I1:N1:G1 (SMILES: COC1=CC=C(/C=C/C2=NNC3=CC(Cl)=CC=C23)C=C1C(=O)NC), which improved docking and reduced logP. However, for MC:I1:N2:G1 (SMILES: OCCN1CCN(CC2=C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4C2=O)CC1C(=O)NC), the docking score decreased compared to its parent (MC:I1:N4:G1, SMILES: OCCN1CCN(CC2=C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4C2=O)CC1C), despite the rationale of increased polarity and H-bonding. This suggests that the modification may have disrupted key binding interactions. Future modifications should be more tightly coupled to observed binding site interactions, not just general drug-likeness."\n        },\n        {\n            "category": "Ranking and Prioritization",\n            "feedback": "The Ranking Agent correctly prioritized MC:I1:N4:G1 (SMILES: OCCN1CCN(CC2=C(C3=CC=CC=C3)C4=CC=CC=C4C2=O)CC1C) due to its excellent docking (-9.93), high QED (0.89), and low SA (2.86). However, the rationale for the relative ranking of MC:I1:N1:G1 (SMILES: COC1=CC=C(/C=C/C2=NNC3=CC(Cl)=CC=C23)C=C1C(=O)NC) versus AI:I1:N2:G0 (SMILES: N=1CC=C2NC(NCC3=CC=CC=C3)=CN=C2C=1C4=CC=CC5=CC=CN=C45) could be more explicit—does the team value docking over QED, or is there a threshold for each metric?"\n        },\n        {\n            "category": "Documentation and SAR",\n            "feedback": "The friendly_id system is being used correctly, and parent-child relationships are clear. However, SAR conclusions are not yet being explicitly drawn. For example, what did the team learn about the effect of amide introduction in MC:I1:N1:G1 versus MC:I1:N3:G1? More explicit SAR commentary would strengthen the scientific narrative."\n        },\n        {\n            "category": "Recommendations for Next Iteration",\n            "feedback": "1. When proposing modifications, explicitly link changes to observed binding site interactions (from PLIP or docking) rather than general drug-likeness. 2. Clarify the prioritization criteria for ranking—are there hard cutoffs for docking/QED/SA, or is it a weighted approach? 3. Provide explicit SAR insights after each round of modifications. 4. For molecules with strong docking but poor QED/SA (e.g., AI:I1:N2:G0), consider targeted modifications to address these weaknesses."\n        }\n    ],\n    "summaries": [\n        {\n            "iteration": 1,\n            "summary": "The team has established a strong workflow and generated promising AKT1 inhibitor candidates. To improve scientific rigor, future iterations should more tightly couple modifications to binding site data, clarify ranking criteria, and explicitly document SAR insights.
