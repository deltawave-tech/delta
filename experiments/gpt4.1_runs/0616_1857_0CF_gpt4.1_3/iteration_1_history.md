Your task is to iteratively refine candidate molecules using each agent’s specialized expertise. \nThe final goal is to deliver 10 optimized molecules with clearly documented modifications and supporting *in silico* metrics. For the target given by the user.\n\n**Inter-Iteration Process:**\n* At the end of each iterations (expect the last iteration: 3), the Principal Researcher will provide a 'Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration'.\n* This summary, along with all molecules generated, will be the primary context carried forward to the next iteration.\n* **Agent Availability Changes:**\n    * **Iteration 1 (Current):** Database Agent, AI Expert, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent, Scientific Critic, Principal Researcher.\n    * **Iteration 2 (LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT):** Principal Researcher, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent, Scientific Critic. (Database Agent & AI Expert will NOT be present).\n    * **Iteration 3 (FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT):** Principal Researcher, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent. (Database Agent, AI Expert, & Scientific Critic will NOT be present).\n\n==============================================================\nMEETING CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  **Overall Objective:**\n    * Optimize de novo molecules for a specific target by incorporating cross-disciplinary *in silico* insights.\n    * Integrate modifications with clear rationales and *in silico* metrics (e.g., docking scores, QED, SA score, molecular weight).\n    * Present 10 final optimized molecules with their *in silico* data at the end of Iteration 3.\n\n2.  **Agents & Their Roles (General - specific iteration presence noted above):**\n    * **Database Agent:** Retrieves and aggregates data from chemical and biological databases (e.g., UniProt, PDB, ChEMBL). Provide reference data on active/inactive molecules along with their metrics.\n    * **AI Expert:** Uses deep learning and generative models for *de novo* molecule design.\n    * **Medicinal Chemist:** Modifies molecules to improve *in silico* properties (activity, drug-likeness) and evaluates them using its tools (e.g., VINA_REPORT).\n    * **Ranking Agent:** Ranks molecules based on multi-parameter *in silico* evaluation.\n    * **Scientific Critic:** Reviews discussion for logical consistency, completeness, and scientific rigor within the *in silico* framework.\n    * **Principal Researcher:** Leads the team, sets goals, synthesizes information, and provides iterative summaries and directives.\n\n3.  **Decision Pathways (Guidance for PR within iterations):**\n    * The Principal Researcher will guide discussions and help the team converge on promising strategies based on agent inputs.\n\n==============================================================\nRULES & FLOW (for the current iteration)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n-   **Kick-off:** The Principal Researcher will start by stating the overall project goal (already known) and the specific objectives for **this current iteration (Iteration 1)**.\n-   **Data Sharing (Iteration 1):** The Database Agent will typically be called upon early to provide reference data (protein sequence, protein PDB file, active/inactive molecules, etc.)\n-   **Discussion:** Agents will propose modifications, debate impacts using *in silico* metrics, and refine ideas.\n-   **Closure of Iteration:** The Principal Researcher will conclude the iteration by providing their summary and directives for the next.\n-   **Output Format for Molecules (when presented by Database, AI, MedChem):**\n    (Your existing structured format including SMILES, friendly_id, metrics, etc., should be detailed here if it's not part of a separate `molecule_format_guide` in the agent's system prompt)\n    * Ensure all molecules have relevant *in silico* metrics (docking scores, QED, SA score, etc.) for ranking and progress tracking.\n\n==============================================================\nEND of CONTEXT\n  "}]

For molecules with strong docking but poor QED or high logP (e.g., DA:I0:N4:G0), clear plans for addressing these liabilities should be articulated. For de novo molecules, scaffold novelty and synthetic feasibility should be explicitly discussed. In the next iteration, a more systematic SAR exploration and explicit flagging of liabilities will be essential for scientific rigor."\n        }\n    ]\n}\n</molecules>'}]
