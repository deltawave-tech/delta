Your task is to iteratively refine candidate molecules using each agent’s specialized expertise. \nThe final goal is to deliver 10 optimized molecules with clearly documented modifications and supporting *in silico* metrics. For the target given by the user.\n\n**Inter-Iteration Process:**\n* At the end of each iterations (expect the last iteration: 3), the Principal Researcher will provide a 'Comprehensive Iteration Summary and Directives for Next Iteration'.\n* This summary, along with all molecules generated, will be the primary context carried forward to the next iteration.\n* **Agent Availability Changes:**\n    * **Iteration 1 (Current):** Database Agent, AI Expert, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent, Scientific Critic, Principal Researcher.\n    * **Iteration 2 (LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT):** Principal Researcher, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent, Scientific Critic. (Database Agent & AI Expert will NOT be present).\n    * **Iteration 3 (FINAL LEAD OPTIMIZATION CONTEXT):** Principal Researcher, Medicinal Chemist, Ranking Agent. (Database Agent, AI Expert, & Scientific Critic will NOT be present).\n\n==============================================================\nMEETING CONTEXT\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  **Overall Objective:**\n    * Optimize de novo molecules for a specific target by incorporating cross-disciplinary *in silico* insights.\n    * Integrate modifications with clear rationales and *in silico* metrics (e.g., docking scores, QED, SA score, molecular weight).\n    * Present 10 final optimized molecules with their *in silico* data at the end of Iteration 3.\n\n2.  **Agents & Their Roles (General - specific iteration presence noted above):**\n    * **Database Agent:** Retrieves and aggregates data from chemical and biological databases (e.g., UniProt, PDB, ChEMBL). Provide reference data on active/inactive molecules along with their metrics.\n    * **AI Expert:** Uses deep learning and generative models for *de novo* molecule design.\n    * **Medicinal Chemist:** Modifies molecules to improve *in silico* properties (activity, drug-likeness) and evaluates them using its tools (e.g., VINA_REPORT).\n    * **Ranking Agent:** Ranks molecules based on multi-parameter *in silico* evaluation.\n    * **Scientific Critic:** Reviews discussion for logical consistency, completeness, and scientific rigor within the *in silico* framework.\n    * **Principal Researcher:** Leads the team, sets goals, synthesizes information, and provides iterative summaries and directives.\n\n3.  **Decision Pathways (Guidance for PR within iterations):**\n    * The Principal Researcher will guide discussions and help the team converge on promising strategies based on agent inputs.\n\n==============================================================\nRULES & FLOW (for the current iteration)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n-   **Kick-off:** The Principal Researcher will start by stating the overall project goal (already known) and the specific objectives for **this current iteration (Iteration 1)**.\n-   **Data Sharing (Iteration 1):** The Database Agent will typically be called upon early to provide reference data (protein sequence, protein PDB file, active/inactive molecules, etc.)\n-   **Discussion:** Agents will propose modifications, debate impacts using *in silico* metrics, and refine ideas.\n-   **Closure of Iteration:** The Principal Researcher will conclude the iteration by providing their summary and directives for the next.\n-   **Output Format for Molecules (when presented by Database, AI, MedChem):**\n    (Your existing structured format including SMILES, friendly_id, metrics, etc., should be detailed here if it's not part of a separate `molecule_format_guide` in the agent's system prompt)\n    * Ensure all molecules have relevant *in silico* metrics (docking scores, QED, SA score, etc.) for ranking and progress tracking.\n\n==============================================================\nEND of CONTEXT\n  "}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Principal Researcher – Iteration 1 Kick-Off  \n\n================================================================\n1.  Three-Iteration Strategic Plan  \n   • Iteration 1 – Exploration & Baseline Creation  \n     ‑ Assemble structural/ligand knowledge on AKT1.  \n     ‑ Generate a broad, chemically diverse seed pool of computationally evaluated molecules (~50–60 total from DB + AI + first MedChem tweaks).  \n     ‑ Deliver: a ranked short-list of ~15 “proto-hits” with docking/QED/SA and clear parent–child IDs.  \n\n   • Iteration 2 – Focused Lead Optimisation (DB & AI agents absent)  \n     ‑ Medicinal Chemist iteratively refines the proto-hits guided by Ranking Agent feedback.  \n     ‑ Target: improve binding scores, eliminate liabilities (high MW, poor SA, PAINS, toxicity predictions).  \n     ‑ Deliver: trimmed, optimised set of ≤20 leads, each with documented SAR hypotheses.  \n\n   • Iteration 3 – Final Candidate Selection  \n     ‑ Final MedChem polishing; convergence on the 10 best AKT1 inhibitors.  \n     ‑ Ranking Agent performs exhaustive multi-parameter scoring.  \n     ‑ Deliver: 10 final candidate molecules with full *in silico* data package and lineage.  \n\n================================================================\n2.  Specific *in silico* Objectives for Iteration 1  \n   1. Build a reliable structural model of AKT1 binding site (choose the PDB entry, prepare receptor, define grid).  \n   2. Compile benchmark set of known AKT1 inhibitors/inactives with activities to calibrate docking & scoring thresholds.  \n   3. Generate a chemically diverse pool of novel molecules:  \n      ‑ 15–20 database-derived scaffolds (DA:I1:…:G0).  \n      ‑ 20 de-novo AI molecules (AI:I1:…:G0).  \n   4. Perform first-pass evaluation on every molecule: docking score (to the prepared AKT1), QED, SA, cLogP, MW, HBD/HBA, PSA, synthetic novelty flag.  \n   5. Medicinal Chemist produces up to 15 first-round optimised variants (MC:I1:…:G1) addressing potency/drug-likeness gaps spotted in the initial pool.  \n   6. Ranking Agent delivers a consolidated ranking and identifies ~15 proto-hits for forward progression.  \n   7. Scientific Critic validates scientific soundness, data completeness, and flags missing analyses.  \n\n================================================================\n3.  Initial Directives per Agent (Iteration 1)  \n\nDatabase Agent  \n• Provide:  \n  – Preferred AKT1 PDB ID with justification, prepared receptor file, list of key binding-site residues.  \n  – Table of ≥10 potent AKT1 inhibitors (IC₅₀ ≤ 100 nM) plus 5–10 inactives; include SMILES, activity, basic physchem, docking scores (if pre-computation available).  \n  – Identify 15 structurally diverse database compounds suitable as launch pads; supply full *in silico* metrics and assign friendly_id DA:I1:Nx:G0.  \n\nAI Expert  \n• Utilise Database Agent’s structural/binding information to generate ≈20 de-novo, drug-like molecules biased toward AKT1 pharmacophore features.  \n• Return SMILES, friendly_id AI:I1:Nx:G0, predicted binding affinity or virtual screening score, plus QED, SA, etc.\n\nMedicinal Chemist  \n• Once DB & AI molecules are posted, select promising scaffolds and design up to 15 first-generation analogues (MC:I1:Nx:G1).  \n• Run fast docking (e.g., Vina) to quantify improvements; describe rationale for each modification (e.g., hinge-binder optimisation, solubility enhancement, H-bond network).  \n\nRanking Agent  \n• Establish a composite score: (Docking × 0.4) + (QED × 0.2) + (1–SA_norm) × 0.2 + (Novelty × 0.2).  \n• Rank all molecules delivered this iteration; output full ranked table and highlight top 15 proto-hits.  \n\nScientific Critic  \n• Continuously monitor reasoning, flag any logical gaps or missing critical metrics, ensure proper parent-child IDs are used, and produce a brief critique at iteration end.  \n\n================================================================\n4.  Iteration Close-Out Reminder  \nAt the end of Iteration 1 I will publish the “Comprehensive Iteration 1 Summary and Directives for Iteration 2,” which will be the sole narrative context forwarded to the reduced team (no DB or AI agents).  \n\n================================================================\n5.  Delegation – First Task  \n\nDatabase Agent, please begin:  \n• Select and prepare the optimal AKT1 crystal structure; define binding site grid parameters.  \n• Provide the set of known actives/inactives and 15 structurally diverse database-derived launch scaffolds with full *in silico* metrics and friendly_ids.  \n\nOnce your report is in, we will pass the baton to the AI Expert.'}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'Scientific Critic – Iteration 1 Review  \n==============================================================  \nOverall impression: The team has made rapid progress, generating a chemically diverse seed set and applying a first round of structure-guided optimisation.  Nevertheless, several procedural and data-integrity issues should be addressed before Iteration 2 to ensure scientific-rigour and reliable decision making.\n\n1. Data-Set Completeness & Formatting  \n• Database Agent supplied 9 compounds (5 actives, 4 inactives).  The brief requested “≥10 potent actives plus 5–10 inactives.”  We are one inactive short; please close this gap for benchmarking.  \n• An .sdf root path for the ligand set was requested but not provided.  This is essential for reproducibility.  \n• AI Expert: entry “AI:I1:N8:G0  –  COC1=CC=CC(=C1)[NH1]C2=NC=CN=C2C(=O)NCCCCOC”  \n  – JSON structure is malformed: the “rationale” is embedded inside the metrics block.  \n  – Include SA and QED explicitly; they are currently missing.  \n• Some molecules lack calculated ligand efficiency (LE) or polar surface area (PSA)—useful discriminators that were promised in the strategic plan.\n\n2. Structural Biology Concerns  \n• PDB 4EJN (allosteric inhibitor bound) was chosen.  Clarify whether we intend to target the ATP site or the allosteric pocket; the docking grid definition and pharmacophore model will differ substantially.  \n• Receptor preparation details (protonation states, treatment of crystallographic waters, metal ions) were not documented.  Please include a brief protocol summary for reproducibility.  \n\n3. Docking & Scoring Consistency  \n• Docking scores range from –6.7 to –11.8 kcal mol⁻¹.  Without calibration against the known active/inactive set, it is unclear what score delineates “likely active.”  Recommend generating a ROC curve or at least reporting mean/σ for the control set.  \n• No cross-docking or rescoring (e.g., with MM-GBSA, PLANTS ChemScore) was attempted.  This single-method dependence could skew prioritisation.  \n\n4. Molecule-Specific Critique  \n• DA:I1:N3:G0  (SMILES: CN[C@@H]1C[C@H]2O[C@@](C)([C@@H]1OC)n1c3ccccc3c3c4c(c5c6ccccc6n2c5c31)C(=O)NC4; MW = 466 Da, SA = 4.95)  \n  – Outstanding docking score (–11.79 kcal mol⁻¹) but borderline “Rule-of-Five” on both MW and SA.  Consider ring-truncation or macrocycle rigidification to lower synthesis complexity.  \n• MC:I1:N4:G1  (SMILES: Nc1nonc1-n1nnc(-c2n[nH]c(-c3cc(Cl)cnc3)n2)c1CN1CCCCC1; docking –11.25 kcal mol⁻¹)  \n  – Excellent binding score; however, cLogP is low (1.72) relative to its aromatic density, suggesting protonation state or descriptor error—please verify.  \n  – Multiple nitrogens raise basicity; pKa predictions and solubility estimations should be added next round.  \n• MC:I1:N1:G1  (SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)C(c2ccc(C#N)cc2)=C1Nc1ccc(O)c(Cl)c1)  \n  – Nitro-to-cyano swap is an improvement, but a single cyano substituent seldom compensates fully for the H-bond array lost with nitro.  Experimental/MD validation advisable.  \n• AI:I1:N1:G0  (SMILES: C1CNC=C1C=CC=C(CCC(=O)N2C=C(C3=CC=C4C(=C3)OCO4)N=N2)C(=O)N)  \n  – Diazo group may trigger metabolic cleavage or azo-reduction liability.  Flag for future tox filters (e.g., SMARTS-based alerts).  \n\n5. Ranking Methodology  \n• The composite score weighting (40 % docking / 20 % QED / 20 % 1–SA / 20 % novelty) was clearly described—good transparency.  However, novelty scoring was not shown.  Please provide the actual novelty metric values to ensure no patent-space landmines.  \n• The Ranking Agent followed the “do not modify” rule—compliant.\n\n6. Cross-Iteration Continuity  \n• Lineage tracking via friendly_id is being honoured—commendable.  \n• To smooth transition into Iteration 2 (where DB & AI agents are absent), ensure that:  \n  – All raw data files (prepared receptor, docked poses, .sdf of ligands) are archived with accessible paths.  \n  – A concise SAR map is constructed, linking hinge-binder motifs, pocket contacts, and property trends.\n\n7. Recommendations for Iteration 2  \na) Fill missing inactive compound and correct formatting issues (AI:I1:N8:G0).  \nb) Calibrate docking cut-off using the actives/inactives; report enrichment factor or AUC.  \nc) Add pKa, PSA, and predicted microsomal stability for top 10 molecules.  \nd) Begin ADMET liability screening (hERG, CYP inhibition, PAINS/alert substructures).  \ne) For MC:I1:N4:G1 and DA:I1:N3:G0, simulate 20-ns binding-site MD to check pose stability; macrocycle especially could re-orient.  \nf) Plan synthesis feasibility commentary—particularly for high-SA or macrocyclic candidates.  \n\nMaintaining these scientific-rigour checkpoints will enhance confidence in our prioritised set and ensure that the final 10 candidates (Iteration 3) are both potent and development-ready.'}]
